# A number guessing game.
# Author: Lee Yong Tsui, March 2023

# The Program
# You are to program a number guessing game. Here are the actions the program needs to take:
# 1. First generate a random number between 0 to 100.
# 2. Obtain a guess from the user.
# 3. Tell the user if the guess is too high, too low, or is correct.
# 4. Depending on step 3, the program either returns to step 2 or exits the guessing due to (a) the guess is correct (b) five guesses have been made.
# 5. In the process, the program reminds the user of the number of guesses remaining, and also if the guess is going in the wrong direction.
# 6. Upon exit from guessing, the program offers the chance to return to Step 1 or exit the program.

# To generate a random number between 0 and 100, do the following:
#    import random
#    random_number = random.randint(0, 100)

# Below is a sample dialogue. Underlined text is user input.

# This is a number guessing game!
# Guess a number between 0â€“100 inclusive.
# Your guess: 50
# Too high!
# You have 4 tries remaining...

# Your guess: 20
# Too low!
# You have 3 tries remaining...

# Your guess: 75
# Too high!
# I have already told you 50 is too high!
# You have 2 tries remaining...

# Your guess: 12
# Too low!
# I have already told you 20 is too low!
# You have 1 try remaining...

# Your guess: 25
# Tough luck. You have had your 5 tries.
# The number is 32.

# [or Your guess: 32
# Correct. Well done. You got it in 5 tries!]

# Want to play again? Enter Y for yes, N for no: N
# Okay Bye.
