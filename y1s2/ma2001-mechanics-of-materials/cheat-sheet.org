* Definitions

** Member
An object that experiences stress. It can be something like a rod.

** Two-force member
A two-force member just means that there is no transverse load between the pinned ends of an object.

** Axial loading
Axial loading just means that the object is loaded on a plane parallel to the object's axis. For example, a beam is axially loaded when the forces are on the ends of the beam.

** Normal stress (\(\sigma\))
The force intensity on a section of an object due to axial loading is called normal stress. It is called normal because the force is perpendicular to the plane of the exposed section where the object is cut.

** Centroid
The centroid is the centre of the object.

** Centric (concentric) loading
- A uniform distribution of stress in a section infers that the line of action for the result of the internal forces passes through the *centroid* of the section.
- A uniform distribution of stress is only possible if the concentrated loads on the end sections of two-force members are applied at the centre of the sections at the ends of the object.

\newpage

** Eccentric loading
- Axial loading which does not pass through the centroid of a section produces internal forces equivalent to an axial force and a bending moment.
- If a two-force member is eccentrically loaded, then the resultant of the stress distribution in a section must yield an axial force and a moment.
- The stress distributions in eccentrically loaded members cannot be uniform or symmetric.
- The direction of the force and the resultant moment can be found through equilibrium.

** Shearing stress (\(\tau\))
- Two forces are applied transversely to an object results in a shearing force
- The resultant of the internal shear force distribution is known as the shear of the section and is equal to the load.

\[\tau_{avg} = \frac{F}{A}\]

Where:
- $\tau_{avg}$ is the average shearing stress
- $F$ is the shear force
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the shearing surface, which is the area of the surface that is being sheared.

For a *single shear*, the formula for shearing stress is the above. However, for *double* shear, the force needs to be divided by 2.

\newpage

** Bearing stress (\(\sigma_b\))
- Bolts, rivets, and pins create stresses on the points of contact of the objects.
- The average force intensity is called bearing stress.

\[\sigma_b = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{F}{t \, d}\]

Where:
- $\sigma_b$ is the bearing stress
- $F$ is the force applied by the pin
- $A$ is the projected area
- $t$ is the thickness of the material the pin is in contact with
- $d$ is the diameter of the pin

\newpage

** Factor of safety (\(FS\))
Factor of safety considerations:
- Uncertainty in material properties
- Uncertainty of loadings
- Uncertainty of analyses
- Number of loading cycles
- Types of failure
- Maintenance requirements and deterioration effects
- Importance of member to structure integrity
- Risk to life and property
- Influence on machine function

\[FS = \frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_{all}}\]

Where:
- $FS$ is the factor of safety
- $\sigma_u$ is the ultimate stress
- $\sigma_all$ is the allowable stress

** Normal strain (\(\varepsilon\))
\[\varepsilon = \frac{\delta}{L}\]

Where:
- $\varepsilon$ is the normal strain
- $\delta$ is the extension of the object under strain
- $L$ is the length of the object

** Elastic behaviour
Elastic behaviour is when the strain disappears when the stress is removed. The largest stress for which this occurs is called the elastic limit.

** Plastic (inelastic) behaviour
Plastic behaviour is when the strain does not return to zero after the stress is removed.

** Hooke's Law: Modulus of Elasticity (Stiffness) (\(E\))
For uniaxial stress:
\[\sigma = E \varepsilon \qquad E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}\]

Where:
- $\sigma$ is the normal stress
- $\varepsilon$ is the normal strain
- $E$ is Young's Modulus or Modulus of Elasticity or Elastic Modulus

The strength of a material is affected by alloying, heat treating, and manufacturing process but the stiffness of a material (Modulus of Elasticity) is not.

** Fatigue
- Fatigue properties are shown on stress vs number of cycles to failure graphs.
- A member may fail due to fatigue at stress levels significantly below the ultimate strength if subjected to many loading cycles.
- When the stress is reduced below the *endurance limit*, fatigue failures do not occur for any number of cycles.

\newpage

** Poisson's ratio (\(\nu\))
- For a slender bar subjected to axial loading:
  \[\varepsilon_x = \frac{\sigma_x}{E} \qquad \sigma_y = \sigma_z = 0\]

- The elongation in the \(x\)-direction is accompanied by a contraction in the other directions. Assuming that the material is isotropic (no directional dependence),
  \[\varepsilon_y = \varepsilon_z \ne 0\]

Poisson's ratio is defined as:
\[\nu = \left| \frac{\text{lateral strain}}{\text{axial strain}} \right| = - \frac{\varepsilon_y}{\varepsilon_x} = - \frac{\varepsilon_z}{\varepsilon_x}\]

Where:
- $\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio

\[\varepsilon_x = + \frac{\sigma_x}{E} - \frac{\nu \sigma_y}{E} - \frac{\nu \sigma_z}{E}\]
\[\varepsilon_y = + \frac{\sigma_y}{E} - \frac{\nu \sigma_x}{E} - \frac{\nu \sigma_z}{E}\]

Where:
- $\varepsilon$ is the normal strain on the object in the respective $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions.
- $\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio
- $E$ is the elastic modulus

** Shearing strain (\(\gamma\))
- A cubic element subjected to a shearing stress will deform into a rhomboid. The corresponding *shear strain* is quantified in terms of the change in angle between the sides.
- Shearing stress in one plane only affects shearing strain in the same plane.
- For small strains, \(\tan \gamma \approx \gamma\):

5. Similarly, the normal stress will the \(x\)-coordinate and the corresponding shearing stress will be the \(y\)-coordinate. This point will be called \(Y\).
6. Join the two points that have been plotted with a straight line.
7. The point where the line passes through the \(x\)-axis will be the centre of the circle.
8. Draw the Mohr's circle with the diameter being the length of the straight line.
9. Find the \(x\)-coordinate of the centre of the circle, which is just the average normal stress:
   \[x = \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2}\]

   Where:
   - $x$ is the \(x\)-coordinate of the centre of the circle
   - $\sigma_x$ is the normal stress in the \(x\)-direction
   - $\sigma_y$ is the normal stress in the \(y\)-direction

10. Another method is to use geometry to find the \(x\)-coordinate of the centre of the circle.
11. The centre of the circle will be called \(C\).
12. Find the radius of the circle by using Pythagoras' Theorem, as the radius of the circle is just the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the points C, X and the \(x\)-coordinate of the normal stress in the \(x\)-direction, which will be called point \(F\).

*** Interpreting the Mohr's circle
- The principal stresses will be the points where the circle intersects the \(x\)-axis.
- The minimum normal stress is the stress with a lower \(x\)-value and the maximum stress is the stress with a higher \(x\)-value.
- \(2\theta_p\) or twice the principal plane is the angle between \(CX\) and \(CF\).
- The first angle can be found by using the trigonometric functions \(\sin, \cos\), or \(\tan\). The second angle is just the first angle plus \(90^{\circ}\).
- The maximum in-plane shearing stress can be found from the maximum \(y\)-coordinate of the Mohr's circle.
- The \(x\)-coordinate of the point with the maximum \(y\)-coordinate is the corresponding normal stress, which is also the average normal stress.
- \(2 \theta_s\) or twice the in-plane shearing stress plane can be found by rotating the line \(XY\) to be parallel with the \(y\)-axis and then using trigonometry to find the angle between the rotated line and the original line.
- The angles in the Mohr's circle is *always twice* the given angle.

** Maximum out-of-plane shearing stress (\(\tau_{\text{max(out-of-plane)}}\))
- When the Mohr's circle contains the origin or intersects the origin, there is *no out-of-plane shearing stress*.
- When the principal normal stresses (\(\sigma_{max}\) and \(\sigma_{min}\)) are of the *opposite* sign, there is *no out-of-plane shearing stress*.

\newpage

* Review of statics

** Tie or strut (two-force member)
- Pin-ended members
- Two-force member
- Axial or longitudinal load (no bending) produces axial stresses
- Assume that the member is weightless

** Beam
- Multiple internal forces
- Pin-ended or fix-ended
- Bending produces bending stresses and shearing stresses

\newpage

* Normal stress
- Stress is an *internal* force.
- For an object in *tension*, the stress is *positive*.
- For an object in *tension*, the cross-sectional area to calculate stress must be at the smallest area, like the hinge part of a bar.
- For an object in *compression*, the stress is *negative*.
- For an object in *compression*, the cross-sectional area to calculate the stress is the whole area of the bar.
- The stress at a transition point from tension to compression or vice versa is *undefined*.
- To figure out whether an object is in tension or compression, draw out the object and find the internal forces on the object. The internal forces must balance out the forces acting on the object. Then use the direction of the force to figure out whether the object is in compression or in tension.

\[\sigma = \frac{F}{A}\]

Where:
- $\sigma$ is the normal stress
- $F$ is the force on the ends of the object, or the axial force on the object
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area


* Method of joints
- The object must be a two-force member, or have no transverse load on the object. Weight of the object is assumed to be negligible.


* Stresses in objects
- Axial forces on a two-force member result in only *normal stresses* on a plane cut perpendicular to the member axis.
- Transverse forces on bolts and pins result in only shearing stresses on the plane perpendicular to the bolt or pins axis.
- Either axial or transverse forces may produce both normal and shearing stresses with respect to a plane other than one cut perpendicular to the member axis.


* Stresses on an oblique plane

** Normal stress
\[\sigma = \frac{F}{A} \cos^2 \theta\]

Where:
- $\sigma$ is the normal stress
- $F$ is the axial force on the object
- $A$ is the cross-sectional are of the object
- $\theta$ is the angle between the normal of the oblique plane and the axial force on the object

** Shearing stress
\[\sigma = \frac{F}{A} \sin \theta \cos \theta\]

Where:
- $\sigma$ is the normal stress
- $F$ is the axial force on the object
- $A$ is the cross-sectional are of the object
- $\theta$ is the angle between the normal of the oblique plane and the axial force on the object

** Maximum stresses

*** Normal stress
The maximum normal stress occurs when the oblique plane is perpendicular to the axis of the object.

*** Shearing stress
The maximum shearing stress occurs when the oblique plane is $\pm 45^{\circ}$ with respect to the axis of the object.


* Deformations under axial loading
- From Hooke's Law:
  \[\sigma = E \varepsilon \qquad \varepsilon = \frac{\sigma}{E} = \frac{F}{AE}\]

- From the definition of strain:
  \[\varepsilon = \frac{\delta}{L} = \frac{F}{AE}\]

- Equating and solving for the deformation:
  \[\delta = \frac{FL}{AE}\]

- With variations in loading, cross-section or material properties,
  \[\delta = \sum_i \frac{F_i L_i}{A_i E_i}\]


* Limits (e.g. maximum shearing stress, maximum normal stress, etc.)
The presence of limits (e.g. maximum shearing stress, maximum normal stress, etc.) usually means there is *an answer for each limit*. Each answer that is derived from a limit must then be *compared with each other* in regard to *safety* to get the final correct answer.


* Axial shear
- Torque applied to a shaft produce *shearing stresses* on the faces perpendicular to the axis (basically the ends of a bar or a beam).
- Equilibrium requires the existence of equal stresses on the faces of the two planes containing the axis of the shaft.


* Shaft deformation
- The twisting angle of the shaft is proportional to the applied torque and to the shaft length.

  \[\phi \propto T \text{ and } \phi \propto L\]
  \[\phi = \frac{TL}{GJ}\]

  Where:
  - $\phi$ is the twisting angle of the shaft
  - $T$ is the applied torque
  - $L$ is the shaft length
  - $G$ is the shear modulus
  - $J$ is the polar moment of inertia

- When subjected torsion, every cross-section of a circular shaft remains *planar* and undistorted.
- Cross-sections for hollow and solid circular shafts remain planar and undistorted as a circular shaft is axisymmetric.
- Cross-sections of non-circular (non-axisymmetric) shafts, like rectangular shafts, are distorted when subjected to torsion.


* Pure shear element at \(45^{\circ}\) degrees
- There is only tension and compression, which are normal stresses.
- There is no shearing stress on the element.

\newpage

* Right-hand screw rule
- The four fingers of your right hand must follow the direction of the torque applied.
- The thumb will then give the torque direction.
- The torque direction is an arrow with two arrowheads.


* Failure modes of a bar

** Summary
[[./images/failure-modes-summary.png]]

\newpage

** Torsional failure modes

*** Ductile materials
- Ductile materials generally fail in *shear*. They are weaker in shear than in tension.
- When subjected to torsion, a ductile material breaks along the plane of *maximum shear*, which is a plane perpendicular to the shaft's axis.

[[./images/ductile-material-torsional-failure.png]]

*** Brittle materials
- Brittle materials generally fail in *tension*. They are weaker in tension than in shear.
- When subjected to torsion, a brittle material breaks along planes perpendicular to the direction in which *tension is a maximum*, which is along surfaces at \(45^{\circ}\) to the shaft's axis.
- This is called a spiral or helical failure.

[[./images/brittle-material-torsional-failure.png]]

\newpage

* Difference between torque and bending moment

** Torque
Torque is the bending or twisting about the object's longitudinal axis.

** Bending moment
Bending moment is bending the object about an axis that is *perpendicular* to the member's longitudinal axis.


* Bending deformations
For a beam with a plane of symmetry in pure bending:
- The beam remains symmetric.
- The beam bends uniformly to form a circular arc.
- The sides of the beam should pass through the centre of the circle and remain planar.
- The length of the *top* side of the beam *decreases* and the length of the *bottom* side *increases*.
- A neutral surface must exist that is parallel to the upper and lower surfaces and for which the length does not change.
- Stresses and strains are *negative (compressive)* above the neutral plane or neutral surface and *positive (tensive)* below it.


* Finding the centroid of an irregularly-shaped object
\[\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum \bar{y} A}{\sum A}\]

Where:
- $\bar{Y}$ is the distance of the centroid from the reference plane
- $\bar{y}$ is the distance of the centroid of an *individual* section of the object from the reference plane
- $A$ is the area of each *individual* section of the object

* Calculating the \(I\) for an irregularly-shaped object

** Method 1: Using parallel axis theorem directly
\[I = \sum \left(\bar{I} + Ad^2 \right) = \sum \left(\frac{1}{12} bh^3 + Ad^2 \right)\]

Where:
- $I$ is the second moment of area of the object
- $\bar{I}$ is the second moment of area for an *individual* section of the object
- $A$ is the area of an *individual* section of the object
- $d$ is the distance from the centroid of the *individual* section from the centroid of the whole object
- $b$ is the base of an *individual* section of the object
- $h$ is the height of an *individual* section of the object

\newpage

** Method 2: Calculate \(I\) about the base of each rectangle

*** Finding the \(I\) about the base of the rectangle
\begin{align*}
I_{base} &= I_{\text{NA}} + Ad^2 \\
&= \frac{bh^3}{12} + bh \left( \frac{h}{2} \right)^2 \\
&= \frac{bh^3}{12} + \frac{bh^3}{4} \\
&= \frac{bh^3}{3}
\end{align*}

Where:
- $I_{base}$ is the second moment of area at the base of a rectangular section of the object
- $I_{\text{NA}}$ is the second moment of area about the neutral axis of a rectangular section of the object
- $b$ is the base of a rectangular section of the object
- $h$ is the height of a rectangular section of the object

*** Summing up the individual \(I\)s to get the \(I\) of the object
- When doing this, all the rectangles taken into account must have their second moment of area (\(I\)) taken at the centroid of the object.
- There will likely be extra space that has been considered, and hence those extra spaces that are not part of the object must be removed by subtracting from the sum below.
- This is useful for objects that are not symmetrical about their neutral axis, such as a T shape cross-section.

\[I = \sum \left( \frac{bh^3}{3} \right)\]

Where:
- $I$ is the second moment of area of the object
- $b$ is the base of a rectangular section of the object
- $h$ is the height of a rectangular section of the object

\newpage

** Method 3: Subtract smaller rectangles from a larger rectangle
- This method only applies when the object is symmetrical about its neutral axis, such as an I-beam.
- The centroid of the rectangular section must *coincide* with the centroid of the object's centroid.

For an I-beam:

#+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 1
[[./images/i-beam-section-moment-of-inertia.png]]

\[I_{\text{NA}} = \frac{bh_1^3}{12} - \frac{(b - t)h_2^3}{12}\]

Where:
- $I_{\text{NA}}$ is the second moment of area of the I-beam
- $b$ is the base of the I-beam
- $h_1$ is the height of the I-beam
- $t$ is the width of the middle section of the I-beam
- $h_2$ is the distance between the bottom part of the I-beam and the top part of the I-beam


* Eccentric Axial Loading

** Determining the resultant force and bending moment on the centroid
1. Transfer the applied force to the centroid of the section and use that applied force to calculate the moment about the centroid
2. Determine the force and the moment using equilibrium equations. Assume a direction for the force and the moment and equate the resultant to zero to find the actual magnitude and direction of the force and the moment.

** General case of eccentric axial loading
- Consider a straight member subject to equal and opposite eccentric forces.
- The eccentric force is equivalent to the system of a centric force and two bending moments.
- The stress at any point can be obtained using the principle of superposition.
- The sign of the stress can be determined through visualisation.

* Beam types

** Statically determinate beams

*** Simply supported beams
Simply supported beams have a fixed end on the left and a roller on the right end.
[[./images/simply-supported-beam-type.png]]

*** Cantilever beams
Cantilever beams are supported from one end, with a fixed support.
[[./images/cantilever-beam-type.png]]

** Statically indeterminate beams

*** Continuous beams

[[./images/continuous-beam-type.png]]

*** Fixed beams

[[./images/fixed-beam-type.png]]

*** Overhanging beams
Overhanging beams are beams with two supports, but one of the supports is not at the end of the beam.
[[./images/overhanging-beam-type.png]]

\newpage

* Sign conventions
1. *Smiley face* or sagging action is considered *positive bending moment*.
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 0.6
   [[./images/bending-moment-sign-convention.png]]

2. A *clockwise rotation* is considered positive shear *force*.
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 0.6
   [[./images/shear-force-sign-convention.png]]

3. *Tension* is *positive* normal stress.
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 0.5
   [[./images/positive-normal-stress.png]]

4. *Shearing stress* is considered *positive* when the *right-hand side* of the element has an arrow pointing *upwards*. Another way to think of it is that the line formed by the arrows of the shearing stress is *positive* when the line has a *positive gradient*.
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 0.7
   [[./images/positive-shear-stress.png]]

5. *Internal forces* should always be assumed to be *positive*.
6. The moment at unconstrained ends must be 0.

\newpage

*** Applying the sign conventions
- These sign conventions only apply when the beam is cut on the right side of the beam, which means the cut part has the *fixed end on the right* and the *free end on the left*.
- If the beam is cut on the left side of the beam, which means the cut part has the *fixed end on the left* and the *free end on the right*, the sign conventions are *reversed*.

* Bending moment and shear force diagrams

** Free body diagram method
1. Draw free body diagrams for each section of interest.
2. Start drawing the free body diagrams starting from both sides so that the answer can be checked.
3. If the final result in the middle calculated both sides are the same, then the answer is most probably correct.
4. Assume internal forces to be positive, which means the bending moment forms a smiley face and the shear force causes a clockwise rotation.
5. Use the equilibrium expressions \(\sum M_i = 0\) and \(\sum F_i = 0\) to find the internal forces.
6. Alternatively, the sign conventions above can also be used to find the internal forces.
7. Distributed loads must always be assumed to act at the centre of the segment of interest after obtaining the total load.

\newpage

** Direct method for shear force diagrams
1. Start from the left of the beam and move across the beam.
2. The shear force starts from zero.
3. When a point load is encountered, add the shear force due to it to the current shear force value. Use the sign convention of upwards shear forces being positive and downwards shear forces being negative. The shear force diagram should have a vertical line to the new shear force value.
4. When a distributed load is encountered, find the effective increase or decrease in shear force due to the distributed load by treating it as a point load. Then, draw a straight line to the new value of the shear force at the end of the distributed load region.
5. Alternatively, jumping over to the right side of the beam and doing point 3 in reverse will also work. Essentially, when working from the right side of the beam, the sign conventions are flipped, so a shear force acting downwards will be considered as positive while a shear force acting upwards will be considered negative and so on.

** Relationship between load and shear force
\begin{align*}
\sum F_y &= 0 \\
V &= (V + \Delta V) + w \Delta x \\
\Delta V &= -w \Delta x \tag{1}
\end{align*}

Dividing both sides of \((1)\) by \(\Delta x\) and let \(\Delta x \rightarrow 0\):
\[\frac{dV}{dx} = -w\]

Where:
- $\sum F_y$ is the sum of the forces in the y-axis on a segment of the object
- $V$ is the shear force on a segment of the object
- $\Delta V$ is the change in the shear force due to the distributed load
- $w$ is the distributed load on a segment of the object
- $\Delta x$ is the length of a segment of the object
- $\frac{dV}{dx}$ is the change in shear force over the length of the object

*** Implications
- When there is *no* distributed load, i.e. \(w = 0\), the shear force is *constant*.
- When there is a *distributed* load, i.e. \(w \ne 0\), the shear force has a *linear* variation.
- The net change in bending moment is equal to the area under the shear distribution segments, i.e:
  \[\text{Change in bending moment, } \Delta M = \text{Area under the shear force diagram}\]

** Relationship between shear force and bending moment
\begin{align*}
\sum M &= 0 \\
(M + \Delta M) + w \Delta x \left(\frac{\Delta x}{2} \right) &= M + V \Delta x \\
\Delta M &= V \Delta x - \frac{1}{2}w\left(\Delta x \right)^2 \\
\Delta M &= (V - \frac{1}{2} w \Delta x) \Delta x \tag{2}
\end{align*}

Dividing both sides of \((2)\) by \(\Delta x\) and let \(\Delta x \rightarrow 0\):
\[\frac{dM}{dx} = V\]

Where:
- $\sum M$ is the sum of moments about a pivot in a segment of the object
- $M$ is the bending moment on a segment of the object
- $\Delta M$ is the change in the bending moment due to the distributed load
- $w$ is the distributed load on a segment of the object
- $\Delta x$ is the length of a segment of the object
- $V$ is the shear force on a segment of the object
- $\frac{dM}{dx}$ is the change in bending moment over the length of the object

*** Implications
- The variation in bending moment is *linear* when the shear force is *constant*, i.e. \(\frac{dV}{dx} = 0\).
- The variation in bending moment is *quadratic* when the shear force is *not* constant, i.e. \(\frac{dV}{dx} \ne 0\).
- The bending moment is *maximum or minimum* when the shear force is zero, or when the shear force line crosses the zero line. Basically, there is a *turning point* in the bending moment diagram whenever the *shear force is zero*.
- The bending moment at *free ends* must be *zero*.

\newpage

* Design of beams for bending
- The largest normal stress is found at the *surface* where the maximum bending moment occurs.
  \[\sigma_m = \frac{|M|_{max} c}{L} = \frac{|M|_{max}}{S}\]

  Where:
  - $\sigma_m$ is the maximum normal stress
  - $|M|_{max}$ is the absolute value of the maximum bending moment
  - $c$ is the outer radius of the beam
  - $L$ is the length of the beam
  - $S$ is the section modulus of the beam

- A safe design requires that the maximum normal stress be lower that the allowable stress for the material used. These criteria lead to the determination of the minimum acceptable section modulus.
  \[\sigma_m \le \sigma_{all}\]
  \[\sigma_{all} = \frac{|M|_{max}}{S_{min}}\]
  \[S_{min} = \frac{|M|_{max}}{\sigma_{all}}\]

  Where:
  - $\sigma_m$ is the maximum normal stress
  - $\sigma_{all}$ is the allowable normal stress

\[\tau_{max} < \frac{\sigma_Y}{2FS}\]

Where:
- $\sigma_Y$ is the material yield stress
- $\tau_{max}$ is the maximum shearing stress
- $FS$ is the factor of safety

*** Maximum distortion energy (Von Mises) criterion
\[\sigma_{max}^2 - \sigma_{max} \sigma_{min} + \sigma_{min}^2 < \left(\frac{\sigma_Y}{FS} \right)^2\]

Where:
- $\sigma_{max}$ is the maximum normal stress
- $\sigma_{min}$ is the minimum normal stress
- $\sigma_{Y}$ is the material yield stress
- $FS$ is the factor of safety

*** Maximum normal stress (Coulomb's) criterion
\[|\sigma_{max}| < \frac{\sigma_U}{FS}\]
\[|\sigma_{min}| < \frac{\sigma_U}{FS}\]

Where:
- $\sigma_{max}$ is the maximum normal stress
- $\sigma_{min}$ is the minimum normal stress
- $\sigma_U$ is the ultimate strength of the material
- $FS$ is the factor of safety

* Deflection of beams
Use the elastic curve and singularity function to find the deflection of beams.
- Assume small deflection \(\theta < \qty{5.73}{\degree}\).
- Begin with the origin on the left end of the beam and cut last section on the right.
- For distributed loads, extend to the distributed load all the way until the right end of the beam and cancel the excess distributed load with another distributed load.
- Use symmetry of the beam if possible, but take note that the boundary condition at the point of symmetry is \(\boldsymbol{y' = 0}\).

** Elastic curve equation
\[EIy'' = M(x)\]
\[EIy' = \int_0^x M(x) \, dx + C_1\]
\[EIy = \int_0^x \, dx \int_0^x M(x) \, dx + C_1 x + C_2\]

Where:
- $E$ is the modulus of elasticity
- $I$ is the second moment of area
- $M$ is the bending moment of the beam, expressed as a function of \(x\), or the distance from the left end of the beam
- $y$ is the general equation for the deflection of the beam at any point. It is a function of \(x\) or the distance from the left end of the beam.

\newpage

** Singularity function method

*** Rules
- The distance \(x\) must be within the last section of the beam, which is on the right of the origin.
- You *cannot expand* a singularity function (<...>).
- When finding constants using boundary conditions, *ignore* the content inside the singularity function (<...>) if it is *negative*.
- If the content inside the singularity function (<...>) is *positive*, *include* it.
- Find constants \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) using boundary conditions of zero or known deflection or slope.
  - For pinned ends, \(y = 0\) when \(x = 0\) and \(x = L\).
  - For clamped ends, \(y = 0\) and \(y' = 0\) when \(x = 0\) and \(x = L\).

*** Distributed load
\[\frac{w}{2} < x - x_0 >^2\]

Where:
- $w$ is the distributed load
- $x$ is a *variable* representing the distance from the *left end* of the beam
- $x_0$ is the location of the *left end* of the distributed load measured from the *left end* of the beam.

*** Point load
\[F_p < x - x_0 >\]

Where:
- $F_p$ is the point load
- $x$ is a *variable* representing the distance from the *left end* of the beam
- $x_0$ is the location of the point load measured from the *left end* of the beam

*** Point moments
\[M < x - x_0 >^0\]

Where:
- $M$ is the point moment
- $x$ is a *variable* representing the distance from the *left end* of the beam
- $x_0$ is the location of the point moment measured from the *left end* of the beam

** Figuring out the point of maximum deflection
- For a single point load in the middle of the beam, the point of maximum deflection will be at the middle of the beam.
- When the point load is moved to one side of a beam, the point of maximum deflection will move with the point load, but it'll lag behind.
- This means that the point of maximum deflection will be closer to the middle of the beam compared to the position of the point load when the point load is not at the middle of the beam.

* Important points to note
1. Forces on an object is assumed to act on the *centroid* unless otherwise stated.
2. Stresses on a point or an element is assumed to be on the *surface* of the structure.
3. The word *'force'* means a force-type quantity, including a concentrated force (\(\unit{N}\)), moment (\(\unit{N.m}\)), or a torque (\(\unit{N.m}\))
4. Internal forces on a member can be *action* or *reaction (equilibrium)* forces.
5. Offset loads must be transferred to the *centroid* at the cross-section of interest.
6. *Action* forces or *reaction (equilibrium)* forces must result in the same stresses on a particular element.
7. Sign conventions are *reversed* when cutting the left side of the beam. Usually, the cuts are on the right side of the beam, not the left.
