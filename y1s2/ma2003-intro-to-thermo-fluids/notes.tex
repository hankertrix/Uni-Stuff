\subsection{System (sys)}
\label{sec:org02ae16a}
\begin{itemize}
\item A system is a collection of fluid particles. It moves, flows and interacts with its surroundings by exerting a force.
\item The mass of air drawn into the compressor of a jet engine is considered a "system". The air changes its properties as it is compressed and expelled through the outlet.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Intensive property}
\label{sec:orgb0b2459}
An intensive property is a physical quantity whose value \textbf{does not} depend on the amount of substance which was measured.
\subsection{Extensive property}
\label{sec:org6eef32b}
An extensive property is a physical quantity whose value \textbf{depends} on the amount of substance which was measured.
\subsection{Specific property}
\label{sec:org4a5a47c}
A specific property is the intensive property obtained by dividing an extensive property of a system by its mass. For example, heat capacity is an extensive property of a system.
\subsection{State}
\label{sec:orga77465f}
The condition of a system described by a set of properties.
\begin{itemize}
\item It is defined by at least \textbf{2 independent intensive} properties, which is usually pressure and volume or pressure and temperature.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Boundary}
\label{sec:org945c58d}
The real or imaginary surface that separates the system from its surroundings.
\subsection{Surroundings}
\label{sec:org18abf57}
The mass or region outside the system.
\subsection{Isolated system}
\label{sec:org591f14e}
An isolated system is a system that \textbf{does not have any exchange} of matter or energy with its surroundings. A thermos bottle containing hot water is one example, as the hot water does not spill out and the water stays hot.
\subsection{Closed system}
\label{sec:org5af5ce9}
A closed system is a system that \textbf{only exchanges energy} with its surroundings. A closed system does not exchange matter with its surroundings. A mercury thermometer is one example.
\subsection{Open system (Flow system)}
\label{sec:org9cd9a02}
An open system is a system where \textbf{both matter and energy} is exchanged with its surroundings. A bacterial cell is an open system, as it takes in organic matter from its surroundings, and releases heat and waste compounds to its surroundings.
\subsection{Control volume (C.V.)}
\label{sec:org6dfe9d5}
\begin{itemize}
\item A control volume is the space enclosed by the control surface in an open system.

\subsubsection{Selection of a control volume}
\label{sec:org1b88162}
\begin{itemize}
\item Make the interested point \textbf{on} the control surface, not "buried" within a control volume.
\item If possible, make the control surface \textbf{perpendicular} to the fluid velocity so that the angle is either \(\qty{0}{\degree}\) or \(\qty{180}{\degree}\).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Control surface (C.S.)}
\label{sec:org08162b1}

\label{sec:org82ce6b0}
Equilibrium is a state of balance, and there are no unbalanced potentials within the system.
\subsubsection{Mechanical equilibrium}
\label{sec:org69543bb}

\item \(F_H\) is the total horizontal force
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Derivation}
\label{sec:org0a0600f}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider a small section (\(ds\)) of the curved surface.
\item Pressure acts perpendicularly to the section.
\end{itemize}

Force perpendicular to the section:
\[dF_R = p \, ds = \rho g h \, ds\]

Horizontal force:
\[dF_R \cos \theta = p \, ds \cos \theta = \rho g h \, ds \cos \theta\]

Hence, the integral of the horizontal force is just the force on a projected vertical plane surface:

\[y_{HR} = \frac{I_{xc}}{y_c A_{proj}} + y_c\]

Vertical force:

\(h \sin \theta\) is the volume above segment \(ds\). Hence, the total vertical force is the total weight of the fluid above the surface.

\[\overline{CM} = \frac{I_0}{V}\]
\[\overline{GM} = \overline{CM} - \overline{CG} = \frac{I_0}{V} - \overline{CG}\]
