* Definitions

** System (sys)
- A system is a collection of fluid particles. It moves, flows and interacts with its surroundings by exerting a force.
- The mass of air drawn into the compressor of a jet engine is considered a "system". The air changes its properties as it is compressed and expelled through the outlet.

** Intensive property
An intensive property is a physical quantity whose value *does not* depend on the amount of substance which was measured.

** Extensive property
An extensive property is a physical quantity whose value *depends* on the amount of substance which was measured.

** Specific property
A specific property is the intensive property obtained by dividing an extensive property of a system by its mass. For example, heat capacity is an extensive property of a system.

** State
The condition of a system described by a set of properties.
- It is defined by at least *2 independent intensive* properties, which is usually pressure and volume or pressure and temperature.

** Boundary
The real or imaginary surface that separates the system from its surroundings.

** Surroundings
The mass or region outside the system.

** Isolated system
An isolated system is a system that *does not have any exchange* of matter or energy with its surroundings. A thermos bottle containing hot water is one example, as the hot water does not spill out and the water stays hot.

** Closed system
A closed system is a system that *only exchanges energy* with its surroundings. A closed system does not exchange matter with its surroundings. A mercury thermometer is one example.

** Open system (Flow system)
An open system is a system where *both matter and energy* is exchanged with its surroundings. A bacterial cell is an open system, as it takes in organic matter from its surroundings, and releases heat and waste compounds to its surroundings.

** Control volume (C.V.)
- A control volume is the space enclosed by the control surface in an open system.
- A control volume is a volume in space through which a fluid may or may not flow.

*** Selection of a control volume
- Make the interested point *on* the control surface, not "buried" within a control volume.
- If possible, make the control surface *perpendicular* to the fluid velocity so that the angle is either \(\qty{0}{\degree}\) or \(\qty{180}{\degree}\).

** Control surface (C.S.)
- A control surface gives a selected region in space or boundary in an open system.
- A control surface is a surface of a control volume.

** Equilibrium
Equilibrium is a state of balance, and there are no unbalanced potentials within the system.

*** Mechanical equilibrium
All forces add up to zero, or the net force on a body is zero. This occurs in systems with weights, springs, etc.

*** Thermal equilibrium
No heat transfer in a system.

*** Chemical equilibrium
No net reaction.

** Process
- A process occurs whenever a system changes from one state to another state.
- Need to specify *initial* and *final* state, as well as the *path*, and the *interaction* with the surroundings.

** Reversible process
Both the system and surroundings are returned to their initial state at the end of the reverse process. It is an idealised process that doesn't happen in reality.

\newpage

** Irreversible process
An irreversible process cannot return both the system and the surroundings to their original conditions.

*** Factors that make a process irreversible
- Friction
- Unrestrained expansion of a fluid
- Mixing of different substances
- Heat transfer through a finite temperature difference
- Chemical reaction

** Quasi-equilibrium process
- An idealised process where a system passes through a series of equilibrium states. Basically, the system changes extremely slowly to improve the efficiency of the system and reduce the irreversibility of the system.
- A process during which the system remains nearly in equilibrium at all times.

** Path
The series of states through which a system passes during a process.

** Cycle
A sequence of processes in which the working fluid returns to its original thermodynamic state.

** Macroscopic forms of energy
Macroscopic forms of energy are possessed by a system as a whole with respect to an external reference frame. Examples of such forms of energy are kinetic and potential energy.

** Microscopic forms of energy
Microscopic forms of energy are related to the molecular structure and degree of molecular activity. An example of such a form of energy is internal energy.

The specific heats of ideal gases are hence functions of temperature only as well:
\[c_v = c_v(T) = \frac{du}{dT}\]

Hence:
\[\Delta u = u_2 - u_1 = \int_1^2 c_v(T) \, dT \cong c_{v_{avg}} \left(T_2 - T_1 \right)\]
\[\Delta h = h_2 - h_1 = \int_1^2 c_p(T) \, dT \cong c_{p_{avg}} \left(T_2 - T_1 \right)\]

    \[\Delta h = h_e - h_i = c_{p_{avg}} \left(T_e - T_i \right)\]

  - The units are \(\unit{kJ.kg^{-1}}\), which means the enthalpy value needs to be multiplied by 1000.

- \(\Delta \text{ke} = \frac{V_e^2 - V_i^2}{2}\) is usually in relation to the magnitude of the enthalpy term, unless velocity is important, like for nozzles and diffusers.

\begin{align*}
p_2 - p_{atm} &= \rho g (0 + h) \\

\end{align*}

Where:
- $p_2$ is the pressure of the fluid at a point under the fluid surface

* Methods to find fluid pressure

** Point of equal pressure method
1. Find 2 points with equal pressure.
2. Equate the sum of the pressure due to the fluids above the first point with the sum of the pressure due to the fluids above the second point.

- Start from a specific point with specified pressure and move along the fluid.
- When there is an *increase* in the *depth* (*decrease* in *height*) of the fluid, *increase* the pressure by the amount required, which is usually \(\rho g h\) of the fluid.
- When there is a *decrease* in the *depth* (*increase* in *height*) of the fluid, *decrease* the pressure by the amount required, which is usually \(\rho g h\) of the fluid.
- Equate the above sum to the last point of interest.

Since pressure varies with depth:
\[p = \rho g h\]
\[F_R = \rho g \sin \theta \int_A y \, dA\]

Using the first moment of area:

\[y_R F_R = \int_A y \, dF, dF = p \, dA\]
\[y_R F_R = \int_A y \rho g y \sin \theta \, dA\]

Since \(F_R = \rho g \sin \theta y_c A\):
\[y_R = \frac{\int_A y^2 \, dA}{y_c A}\]

Since \(I_x = \int_A y^2 \, dA\):
\[y_R = \frac{I_{xc} + Ay_c^2}{y_c A}\]
\[y_R = \frac{I_{xc}}{y_c A} + y_c\]

** Derivation
- Consider a small section (\(ds\)) of the curved surface.
- Pressure acts perpendicularly to the section.

Force perpendicular to the section:
\[dF_R = p \, ds = \rho g h \, ds\]

Horizontal force:
\[dF_R \cos \theta = p \, ds \cos \theta = \rho g h \, ds \cos \theta\]

Hence, the integral of the horizontal force is just the force on a projected vertical plane surface:
\[F_H = \rho g h_c A_{proj}\]
\[y_{HR} = \frac{I_{xc}}{y_c A_{proj}} + y_c\]

Vertical force:
\[dF_R \sin \theta = p \sin \theta \, ds = \rho g h \, ds \sin \theta\]

\(h \sin \theta\) is the volume above segment \(ds\). Hence, the total vertical force is the total weight of the fluid above the surface.

*** Derivation
\[dV_1 = x \tan \alpha \, dA\]
\[dV_2 = - x \tan \alpha \, dA\]
\[dA = w \, dx\]

Locating the centroid of the composite volume:
\[\bar{x} V = \bar{x}_0 V_0 + \bar{x}_1 V_1 + \bar{x}_2 V_2\]
\[\bar{x} V = \int_{V_1} x \, dV_1 - \int x \, dV_2\]
\[\bar{x} V = \tan \alpha \int_A x^2 dA\]
\[\bar{x} V = \tan \alpha I_0\]
\[\bar{x} = \tan \alpha I_0\]

Since \(x = \overline{CM} \tan \alpha\):
