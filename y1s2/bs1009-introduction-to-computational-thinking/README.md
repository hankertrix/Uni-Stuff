# What are these files for?
These files are for the BS1009 project.
Each folder contains the Python code you need to process the data and get the data that you need.
The data files are much too big to be committed into the Git repository,
so you can find them in the releases section on the GitHub page.
Otherwise, you can click on the links below for the data for each academic year.

The code is fully explained with a ton of comments so that you understand what is going on at every part of the program.
Each function in the code represents one cell in the Jupyter notebook.
