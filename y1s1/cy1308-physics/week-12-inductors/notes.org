* Definitions

** Potential difference across an inductor
The potential difference across an inductor depends on the *rate of change of the current*.
\[V_{ab} = L \frac{dI}{dt}\]

Where:
- \(V_{ab}\) is the potential difference across the conductor.
- \(L\) is the self inductance of the conductor.
- \(\frac{dI}{dt}\) is the rate of change of the current with respect to time.

** Inductive reactance (SI Unit: \(\unit{\ohm}\))
\[X_L = \omega L = 2 \pi f L\]

Where:
- \(X_L\) is the inductive reactance.
- \(\omega\) is the angular frequency.
- \(L\) is the inductance.
- \(f\) is the frequency.

** Capacitive reactance (SI Unit: \(\unit{\ohm}\))
\[X_C = \frac{1}{\omega C} = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}\]

Where:
- \(X_C\) is the capacitive reactance.
- \(\omega\) is the angular frequency.
- \(C\) is the capacitance.
- \(f\) is the frequency.

** Resonance in A.C. circuits
\[f_0 = \frac{\omega_0}{2 \pi} = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}\]

Where:
- $f_0$ is the resonance frequency.
- $\omega_0$ is the angular frequency.
- $L$ is the impedance of the circuit.
- $C$ is the capacitance of the circuit.


* RL circuit

Consider the circuit shown above. At the instant the switch is closed, current starts to flow. The voltage or e.m.f induced across the inductor by this change in current from zero to some finite value opposes the change that induces it.

Derivation of $I(t)$. By Kirchhoff's voltage rule:
\begin{align*}
V_0 - IR - L \frac{dI}{dt} = 0 \\
L \frac{dI}{dt} &= V_0 - IR \\
\int_0^I \frac{dI}{V_0 - IR} &= \int_0^t \frac{dt}{L} \\
-\frac{1}{R} \left[\ln |V_0 - IR| \right]_0^I &= \frac{1}{L}[t]_0^t \\
-\frac{1}{R} \left(\ln |V_0 - IR| - \ln |V_0| \right) &= \frac{t}{L} \\
\ln |V_0 - IR| - \ln |V_0| &= -\frac{Rt}{L} \\
\ln \left| \frac{V_0 - IR}{V_0} \right| &= -\frac{Rt}{L} \\
\frac{V_0 - IR}{V_0} &= e^{-\frac{Rt}{L}} \\
V_0 - IR &= V_0 e^{-\frac{Rt}{L}} \\
IR &= V_0 - V_0 e^{- \frac{Rt}{L}} \\
I(t) &= \frac{V_0}{R} \left(1 - e^{- \frac{Rt}{L}} \right)
\end{align*}

** Application: surge arrestor
- If lightning strikes part of an electrical power transmission system, it causes a sudden spike in voltage that can damage the components of the system.
- To minimise these effects, large inductors are incorporated into the transmission system.
- These use the principle that an inductor opposes and suppresses any rapid changes in the current.


* LC circuit (without voltage source)

#+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 0.8
[[./images/lc-circuit.png]]

By Kirchhoff's voltage law:
\[-L \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{Q}{C} = 0 \tag{1}\]

The current comes from the decrease of the capacitor's charge:
\[I = - \frac{dQ}{dt} \tag{2}\]

Substituting $(2)$ into \((1)\):
\[- L \cdot -\frac{d^2Q}{dt^2} + \frac{Q}{C} = 0\]
\[\frac{d^2Q}{dt^2} + \frac{Q}{LC} = 0 \tag{3}\]

Trying \(Q = Q_0 \cos (\omega t + \phi)\) with \((3)\):
\[- \omega^2 Q_0 \cos (\omega t + \phi) + \frac{1}{LC} Q_0 \cos (\omega t + \phi) = 0\]
\[\left(- \omega^2 + \frac{1}{LC} \right) \cos ( \omega t + \phi ) = 0\]
\[\Longrightarrow = \left(- \omega^2 + \frac{1}{LC} \right) = 0\]
\[\omega = 2 \pi f = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}\]

** Graph

** Total energy in the circuit
The total energy in the circuit is constant, it oscillates between the capacitor and the inductor.

\begin{align*}
U &= U_E + U_B \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^2}{C} + \frac{1}{2} LI^2 \\
&= \frac{Q_0}{2C} \left[\cos^2 (\omega t + \phi) + \sin^2 (\omega t + \phi) \right] \\
&= \frac{Q_0^2}{2C}
\end{align*}

The frequency of energy oscillations is twice that of the frequency of charge and current oscillations.

Consider the circuit above. The e.m.f source charges the capacitor initially. When the switch is moved to the lower position, we have an inductor with inductance $L$ and a resistor of resistance $R$ connected in series across the terminals of a charged capacitor, forming an *RCL series circuit*. An RCL circuit exhibits damped harmonic motion if the resistance is not too large.
\\

The charge as a function of time is a sinusoidal oscillation with an exponentially decaying amplitude, and angular frequency:

\[\omega ' = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC} - \frac{R^2}{4L^2}}\]
