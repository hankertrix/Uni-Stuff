# What are these files for?
This folder contains the solutions for the
PS0001 Computational Thinking project in AY24-25.
The project files are given in the directory
called [`project-files`](./project-files).

What you are supposed to do is to make changes
to the template [`picedit.py`](./project-files/picedit.py)
to manipulate an image as described in the project
[PDF file](./project-files/project.pdf).

You can find my solution for the project in the
folder called
[`solution-by-me`](./solution-by-me/picedit.py),
or you can look at another group's solution in the
folder called
[`solution-by-another-group`](./solution-by-another-group/picedit.py).
