* Definitions

** Heat
- Heat is a form of *energy* stored by matter.
- It is associated with the *microscopic movement* of individual particles, like molecular translation, rotation vibration, random motion, etc.

Other forms of energy include:

- Microscopic level
  - Chemical energy (binding of molecules)
  - Electrical energy (binding between charged particles)
  - Atomic energy (binding between protons, neutrons and electrons)

- Macroscopic level (organised / bulk motion)
  - Kinetic energy (\(\frac{1}{2} mv^2\))
  - Potential energy (\(mgh\))

** Heat transfer
- Heat transfer is the transit of energy due to *temperature difference*.
- Heat energy flows from *hot to cold* surfaces.
- There are three modes of heat transfer:
  - *Conduction*
  - *Convection*
  - *Radiation*
- Units:
  - Heat: Joules (\(\unit{J}\)), British thermal units (\(\unit{Btu}\)), calories (\(\unit{cal}\))
  - Rate of heat transfer: Watt (\(\unit{W}\)), British thermal units per hour (\(\unit{Btu.h^{-1}}\)), horsepower (\(\unit{hp}\))

*** Simultaneous heat transfer mechanisms
- Most cases of heat transfer in practical applications involve a combination of heat transfer modes between mediums.
- However, not all three can exist simultaneously in a medium.
  - Opaque solid: Conduction only
  - Fluid: Radiation and convection *or* conduction
  - Vacuum: Radiation only

[[./images/simultaneous-heat-transfer-mechanisms.png]]

** Conduction
- Conduction is the diffusion of heat *from more energetic to adjacent less energetic particles* with *no net bulk motion* between the particles.
- Conduction flows through solids or stationary fluids.
- Conduction in a fluid is a *limiting case* of convection.

*** Fourier's law of conduction
\[\dot{Q} = -kA \frac{dT}{dx}\]
\[\dot{Q} = -kA \frac{dT}{dr}\]
\[\dot{Q} = -kA \frac{T_2 - T_1}{L}\]

Where:
- $\dot{Q}$ is the rate of heat transfer (\(\unit{W}\))
- $A$ is the area *perpendicular* to the heat flow direction (\(\unit{m^2}\))
- $\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the temperature gradient *along heat flow direction* in Cartesian coordinates (\(\unit{K.m^{-1}}\))
- $\frac{dT}{dr}$ is the temperature gradient *along heat flow direction* in polar or cylindrical coordinates (\(\unit{K.m^{-1}}\))
- $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the medium (\(\unit{W.m^{-1}.K^{-1}}\))
- $T_2$ is the temperature at the end of the heat flow
- $T_1$ is the initial temperature at the start of the heat flow
- $L$ is the length the heat has to flow through

** Thermal conductivity (\(k\))
- Thermal conductivity is a measure of a material's ability to conduct heat.
  - Material property (\(\unit{W.m^{-1}.K^{-1}}\))
  - A high value of $k$ means the material is a good heat conductor
  - A low value of $k$ means the material is an insulator of heat
- The value of a material's thermal conductivity varies with temperature, i.e. $k(T)$.
  - For solids and liquids: no fixed trend for the variation of a material's conductivity with temperature.
  - For gases, thermal conductivity increases with temperature.
- The thermal conductivity of various materials can be found table 1-1 of the property tables.

** Heat generation
- Heat generation is the *conversion* of other types of *energy* (mechanical, electrical, chemical, etc.) *into heat* within a medium.
- Heat generation is a *volumetric phenomenon*:
  \[\dot{e}_{gen} (x, y, z, t), \quad \unit{W.m^{-3}}\]
- Total heat generation rate:
  \[\dot{E}_{gen} = \int_V \dot{e}_{gen} dV \quad (\unit{W})\]
- For *uniform* heat generation, \(\dot{e}_{gen} = \text{constant}\):
  \[\dot{E}_{gen} = \dot{e}_{gen} V \quad (\unit{W})\]

** One-dimensional heat conduction (Formula given)
- Heat conduction in most cases can be approximated as being one-dimensional
  - One dominant direction for heat transfer
  - Negligible or no heat transfer in other directions.

*** Derivation

*Details:*
- Energy balance for the "slice" of the volume element:
#+ATTR_LATEX: :align >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{7em} >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{1em} >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{7em} >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{1em} >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{7em} >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{1em} >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{7em}
| Rate of heat conduction at $x$ | $-$ | Rate of heat conduction at $x + \Delta x$ | $+$ | Rate of heat generation inside the element | $=$ | Rate of energy change of the element    |
| \(\dot{Q}_x\)                  | $-$ | \(\dot{Q}_{x + \Delta x}\)                | $+$ | \(\dot{E}_{\text{gen, element}}\)          | $=$ | \(\frac{\Delta E_{element}}{\Delta t}\) |

- For uniform rate of energy generation:
  \[\dot{E}_{\text{gen, element}} = \dot{e}_{gen} V_{element} = \dot{e}_{gen} A \Delta x\]
- Change in energy of the element:
  \begin{align*}
  \Delta E_{element} &= E_{t + \Delta x} - E_t \\
  &= mC(T_{t + \Delta t} - T_t) \\
  &= \rho A \Delta x C (T_{t + \Delta t} - T_t)
  \end{align*}
- Substituting:
  \[\dot{Q}_x - \dot{Q}_{x + \Delta x} + \dot{e}_{gen} A \Delta x = \rho A \Delta x C \frac{(T_{t + \Delta t} - T_t)}{\Delta t}\]
- Divide by \(A \Delta x\):
  \[-\frac{1}{A} \frac{\dot{Q}_{x + \Delta x} - \dot{Q}_x}{\Delta x} + \dot{e}_{gen} = \rho C \frac{(T_{t + \Delta t} - T_t)}{\Delta t}\]
- Taking the limit as \(\Delta x \rightarrow 0\) and \(\Delta t \rightarrow 0\):
  \[-\frac{1}{A} \frac{\partial \dot{Q}}{\partial x} + \dot{e}_{gen} = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\]
- Substituting Fourier's law of conduction, \(\dot{Q} = -kA \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\):
  \[\frac{1}{A} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(kA \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right) + \dot{e}_{gen} = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\]
- Since cross-sectional area is constant:
  \[\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[k(T) \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right] + \dot{e}_{gen} = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\]
- If thermal conductivity $k$ is assumed to be constant:
  \[k \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \dot{e}_{gen} = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \quad (\text{Formula given in exam})\]

*** Special cases in Cartesian coordinates
- Steady-state:
  \[\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = 0\]
  \[k \frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} + \dot{e}_{gen} = 0\]
- Steady-state, no heat generation:
  \[\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = 0, \quad \dot{e}_{gen} = 0\]
  \[\frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} = 0\]
- Transient, no heat generation:
  \[\dot{e}_{gen} = 0\]
  \[k \frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\]

*** Cylindrical coordinates
- In Cartesian coordinates:
  \[\frac{1}{A} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right) + \dot{e}_{gen} = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\]
- Similarly, in cylindrical coordinates:
  \[\frac{1}{A} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right) + \dot{e}_{gen} = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\]
- Substituting the expression \(A = 2 \pi r L\):
  \[\frac{1}{2 \pi r L} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(2k \pi r L \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right) + \dot{e}_{gen} = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\]
- Eliminating the common terms \(2 \pi L\):
  \[\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left[k(T) r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right] + \dot{e}_{gen} = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\]

*** Special cases in cylindrical coordinates
- Constant $k$, steady-state:
  \[\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = 0\]
  \[\frac{k}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right) + \dot{e}_{gen} = 0\]
- Constant $k$, steady-state, no heat generation:
  \[\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = 0, \quad \dot{e}_{gen} = 0\]
  \[\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right) = 0\]
- Constant $k$, transient, no heat generation:
  \[\dot{e}_{gen} = 0\]
  \[\frac{k}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right) = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\]

** Internal heat generation
- Practical applications may involve the conversion of energy into thermal energy within the medium, which is heat generation
  - Resistance heating in wires
  - Exothermic chemical reactions in a solid
  - Nuclear reactions in fuel rods
- Heat generation (\(\dot{e}_{gen}\)) is expressed as *per unit volume* of the medium.

*** Heat generation from electrical resistance heating
\[\dot{e}_{gen} = \frac{\dot{E}_{gen}}{V} = \frac{I^2 R_e}{\pi r_o^2 L} \quad (\unit{W.m^{-3}})\]

Where:
- $\dot{E}_{gen}$ is the electrical power (\(\unit{W}\))
- $V$ is the volume of the wire in (\(\unit{m^3}\))
- $I$ is the current (\(\unit{A}\))
- $R_e$ is the electrical resistance (\(\unit{\ohm}\))
- $r_o$ is the outer radius of the wire
- $L$ is the length of the wire
- $\dot{e}_{gen}$ is the volumetric heat generation rate (\(\unit{W.m^{-3}}\))

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Steady internal heat generation
- Considering steady-state conditions, heat generated is transferred out of the solid at the same rate:
  #+ATTR_LATEX: :align >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{12em} >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{1em} >{\centering\arraybackslash}m{12em}
  | Rate of *heat generation* inside the solid | $=$ | Rate of *heat transfer from the solid* |
  | \(\dot{E}_{gen} = \dot{e}_{gen} V\)        | $=$ | \(\dot{Q}\)                            |
- In the event that heat is lost to the surroundings through convection heat transfer only:
  \[\dot{Q} = h A_s (T_s - T_{\infty})\]
  \[\dot{e}_{gen} V = h A_s (T_s - T_{\infty})\]
  \[T_s = T_{\infty} + \frac{\dot{e}_{gen} V}{h A_s}\]
  \[k \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \dot{e}_{gen} = \rho C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\]
- Steady state heat conduction equation:
  \[\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = 0\]
  \[k \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \dot{e}_{gen} = 0\]
  \[\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\dot{e}_{gen}}{k} = 0\]
- Integrating twice:
  \[T(x) = - \frac{\dot{e}_{gen}}{2k} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2\]
- Needs two boundary conditions to solve the two constants of integration:
  \[T(x = -L) = T_1, \qquad T(x = L) = T_2\]

@@latex: \newpage@@

- Use boundary conditions to solve for $C_1$ and \(C_2\):
  1. \(T(x = -L) = T_1\)
     \[T_1 = - \frac{\dot{e}_{gen}}{2k} L^2 - C_1 L + C_2\]
  2. \(T(x = L) = T_1\)
     \[T_1 = - \frac{\dot{e}_{gen}}{2k} L^2 + C_1 L + C_2\]
  \[C_1 = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{2L}\]
  \[C_2 = \frac{\dot{e}_{gen}}{2k} L^2 + \frac{T_1 + T_2}{2}\]
- Temperature distribution:
  \[T(x) = \frac{\dot{e}_g L^2}{2k} \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{L^2} \right) + \frac{T_2 - T_2}{2} \left(\frac{x}{L} \right) + \frac{T_1 + T_2}{2}\]

*** Temperature distribution in cylinders
- Steady-state heat conduction in cylindrical coordinates:
  \[\frac{k}{r} \frac{d}{dr} \left(r \frac{dT}{dr} \right) + \dot{e}_{gen} = 0\]
  \[\frac{1}{r} \frac{d}{dr} \left(r \frac{dT}{dr} \right) + \frac{\dot{e}_{gen}}{k} = 0 \quad (\text{Formula given in exam})\]
- Integrating twice:
  \[T(r) = - \frac{\dot{e}_{gen}}{4k} r^2 + C_1 \ln r + C_2\]
- Boundary conditions:
  \[T(r = r_o) = T_s\]
  \[T(r = 0) = \text{finite}\]
  \[\frac{dT}{dr}(r = 0) = 0 \quad (\text{Symmetry})\]
- Use boundary conditions to solve for $C_1$ and \(C_2\):
  1. \(T(r = 0) = \text{finite}\):
     \[T(r = 0) = C_1 \ln 0 + C_2\]
     \[C_1 = 0\]
  2. \(T(r= r_o) = T_s\):
     \[T_s = - \frac{e\dot{e}_{gen}}{4k} r_o^2 + C_2\]
     \[C_2 = T_s + \frac{\dot{e}_{gen} r_o^2}{4k}\]
- Temperature distribution:
  \[T(r) = \frac{\dot{e}_{gen} r_o^2}{4k} \left(1 - \frac{r^2}{r_o^2} \right) + T_2\]

** Convection
- Convection is the transfer of heat through *bulk motion* of the fluid.
- Convection requires the presence of a material (fluid) medium.
- It is more complicated as it involves fluid motion and conduction.

*** Newton's law of cooling
\[\dot{Q} = hA \Delta T\]

Where:
- $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient (\(\unit{W.m^{-2}.K^{-1}}\))
- $A$ is the area through which heat is transferred
- $\Delta T$ is the temperature difference between bulk fluid temperature and surface temperature

** Radiation
Radiation is the energy emitted by matter in the form of electromagnetic waves (Maxwell) or photons (Planck).
- *No medium* is required for heat transmission
- Any matter above absolute zero (\(\qty{0}{K}\)) emits electromagnetic radiation

[[./images/electromagnetic-spectrum-for-thermal-radiation.png]]

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Electromagnetic radiation
- An idealised surface that emits *radiation* at the *max* rate is called a *blackbody*.
- Rate of emission from a blackbody (the maximum possible rate) at $T_s$ is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law of Radiation:
  \[\dot{Q}_{\text{emit, max}} = \sigma A_s T_s^4\]

  Where:
  - $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (\(5.670 \times 10^{-8} \ \unit{W.m^{-2}.K^{-4}}\))

- All *real* surfaces emit *less* radiation than a blackbody at the same temperature:
  \[\dot{Q}_{emit} = \varepsilon \sigma A_s T_s^4\]

  Where:
  - $\varepsilon$ is the emissivity of the surface (\(0 \le \varepsilon \le 1\))

*** Typical values of emissivity
[[./images/typical-values-of-emissivity.png]]

*** Net radiation exchange
- Difference between the rates of radiation emission and radiation absorption for a surface is the net radiation heat exchange.
  - Rate of emission > rate of absorption means heat is lost
  - Rate of emissions < rate of absorption means heat is gained
- Radiation rate transfer between a surface and its surroundings:
  \[\dot{Q}_{rad} = \dot{Q}_{emit} - \dot{Q}_{absorbed}\]
  \[\dot{Q}_{rad} = \varepsilon \sigma A_s T_s^4 - \alpha \sigma A_s T_{surr}^4\]
  \[\dot{Q}_{rad} = \varepsilon \sigma A_s \left(T_s^4 - T_{surr}^4 \right)\]

- Boundary conditions for a plane wall:
  \[T(x = 0) = T_1 \quad T(x = L) = T_2\]

- Rearranging:
  \[\dot{Q} = \frac{(T_{\infty 1} - T_1)}{\frac{1}{h_1 A}} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{\frac{L}{kA}} = \frac{(T_2 - T_{\infty 2})}{\frac{1}{h_2 A}}\]
  \[\dot{Q} = \frac{(T_{\infty 1} - T_1)}{R_{\text{conv, 1}}} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{R_{wall}} = \frac{(T_2 - T_{\infty 2})}{R_{\text{conv, 2}}}\]

- If the thermal resistances and temperatures at the end points are known, heat transfer rate can be calculated *without* evaluation of wall temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$.
- Heat transfer rate:
  \[\dot{Q} = \frac{T_{\infty 1} - T_{\infty 2}}{R_{\text{conv, 1}} + R_{wall} + R_{\text{conv, 2}}} = \frac{T_{\infty 1} - T_{\infty 2}}{R_{total}}\]

  \[\dot{Q} = UA \Delta T\]

  Where:
  - $U$ is the *overall heat transfer coefficient* in $\unit{W.m^{2}.K}$
  - $UA = \frac{\dot{Q}}{\Delta T} = \frac{1}{R_{total}}$

** Thermal resistance network
For composite walls, evaluation of equivalent thermal resistance follows the same rules and methods used for electrical resistances.

*** Combined series-parallel resistances
[[./images/thermal-resistances-combined.png]]
[[./images/thermal-resistances-combined-electrical-analogy.png]]
\[R_1 = \frac{L_1}{k_1 A_1} \quad R_2 = \frac{L_2}{k_2 A_2} \quad R_3 = \frac{L_3}{k_3 A_3}\]
\[R_{total} = R_{1 + 2} + R_3 = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} + R_3\]
\[\dot{Q}_3 = \dot{Q}_1 + \dot{Q}_2\]
\[\dot{Q} = \dot{Q}_3 = \frac{T_h - T_c}{R_{total}}\]

*** Remarks
- Most heat transfer analysis occur under steady conditions and surface temperature.
- It is useful for analysing practical steady-state heat transfer problems.
- No need to solve conduction differential equations.

  - Thermal circuit can be solved using the same rules and methods used for solving electrical resistance circuits.

- Consider a 2-layer composite plane wall with perfect contact at the interface:
  - The heat is conducted across uniformly.
- In reality, there is imperfect contact (surface roughness) resulting in *non-uniform heat transfer* across the surface.
  - Air gaps act as insulators due to low thermal conductivity of air.

*** Criteria
- Lumped system analysis is only *valid* when *temperature distribution* in the body is *uniform*.
  - Ensure that temperature variation in the body is not drastic in order to use lumped system analysis.
  - Rate of conduction within the body has to be relatively quick.
- For example, if the rate of convection heat transfer is much higher than the rate of conduction within the body:
  - Surface temperature of the body will be different form its internal temperature.
  - Lumped system analysis would *not be valid*.
- The criteria for checking the validity of using the lumped system analysis requires the *comparison* of the *rate of convection* heat transfer to the *rate of conduction* heat transfer within the body.
- Convection heat transfer is proportional to the surface area of the body.
- Conduction heat transfer depends on the area and size (length scale) of the body.
- Using the characteristic length of a body:
  \[b = \frac{h A_s}{\rho V c} = \frac{h}{\rho c L_c} \quad (\unit{s^{-1}})\]
  \[\tau = \frac{\rho V c}{h A_s} = \frac{\rho c L_c}{h} \quad (\unit{s})\]

** Biot number (\(Bi\))
- The Biot number (\(Bi\)) is a dimensionless constant that compares the convection heat transfer *at the surface of the body* to the conduction heat transfer *within the body*.

  \[Bi = \frac{\text{convection}}{\text{conduction}} = \frac{h}{\frac{k}{L_c}} \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta T}\]
  \[Bi = \frac{hL_c}{k}\]
- Lumped system analysis is only *valid* when the rate of convection is much slower than the rate of conduction, i.e. Biot number is *small*:
  \[Bi \le 0.1\]

*** Thermal resistance perspective
- The Biot number (\(Bi\)) is also the ratio of *internal resistance* of a body to heat conduction to its *external resistance* to heat convection:
  \begin{align*}
  Bi &= \frac{\text{Convection}}{\text{Conduction}} \\
  &= \frac{h}{\frac{k}{L_c}} \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta T} \\
  &= \frac{\frac{L_c}{k}}{\frac{1}{h}} \\
  &= \frac{\text{Conduction resistance within the body}}{\text{Convection resistance at the surface of the body}}
  \end{align*}
- Lumped system analysis is valid when \(Bi \le 0.1\):
  - Thermal resistance to conduction is very small so that heat can distribute quickly within the body.

** Types of flow in convection

*** Forced flow
A fluid is forced to flow over a surface or in a pipe by external means such as a pump or a fan.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 18em
[[./images/forced-flow-diagram.png]]

*** Natural flow
Fluid motion due to natural means such as the buoyancy effect (density). Warmer and lighter fluids rise while cooler and denser fluids fall.
[[./images/natural-flow-diagram.png]]

*** External flow
The flow of an unbounded fluid over a surface such as a plate, a wire or a pipe. Some examples include:
- Flow over a flat plate
- Flow over cylinder or spheres

[[./images/external-flow-diagram.png]]

*** Internal flow
The flow in a pipe or duct if the fluid is completely bounded by solid surfaces.
- Flow between parallel plates
- Flow inside tubes

[[./images/internal-flow-diagram.png]]

*** Open-channel flow (not tested)
The flow in a pipe or duct is only partially filled with the liquid and there is a free surface.

*** Steady flow
- The term *steady* implies that there is no change with respect to time.
- Many devices such as turbines, compressors, boilers, condensers, and heat exchangers operate for long periods of time under the same conditions, and they are classified as *steady-flow devices*.

*** Unsteady flow
Unsteady flow means the flow changes with time, which is the opposite of steady flow.

*** Uniform flow
Uniform flow refers to flow that does not change in location over a specified region.

*** Periodic flow
Periodic flow is a kind of *unsteady* flow in which the flow oscillates about a *steady mean*.

** Physical mechanism of convection
The fluid motion brings warmer and cooler chunks of fluid into contact, initiating higher rates of conduction at a greater number of sites in a fluid. The rate of heat transfer through a fluid by convection is *much higher* than by conduction. @@latex: \\@@

Convection heat transfer coefficient is the rate of heat transfer between a *solid surface* and *a fluid* per unit surface area per unit temperature difference. $h$ has units \(\unit{W.m^{-2}.K^{-1}}\).

*** In forced convection
$h$ in *forced convection* depends on:
1. Fluid properties, which includes dynamic viscosity, thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat.
2. Fluid velocity.
3. Type of fluid flow, either streamlined or laminar, or turbulent.
4. Geometry and the roughness of the solid surface.

** No-slip boundary condition
An assumption that a fluid in direct contact with a solid "sticks" to the surface due to viscous effects, which results in a non-uniform velocity profile.

*** Heat transfer
- On the wall surface, a fluid layer sticks to the surface (motionless), hence heat transfer is by *pure conduction*.

  \[\dot{q}_{conv} = \dot{q}_{cond} = - k_{fluid} \left. \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right|_{y = 0} \quad (\unit{W.m^{-2}})\]

- If the temperature distribution within the fluid is known, $h$ can be obtained from:
  \[h = \frac{-k_{fluid} \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right)_{y=0}}{T_s - T_{\infty}} \quad (\unit{W.m^{-2}.\degreeCelsius^{-1}})\]

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Local heat transfer coefficient (\(h_{local}\))
$h$ generally varies along the flow (or \(x\)) direction. The *average* or *mean* $h$ for a surface is determined by properly averaging the *local* $h$ over the entire surface area $A_s$, or length \(L\):
\[h = \frac{1}{A_s} \int_{A_s} h_{local} \, dA_s\]
\[h = \frac{1}{L} \int_0^L h_x \, dx\]

- The hypothetical line of \(u = 0.99V\) divides the flow over a plate into two regions:
  [[./images/velocity-boundary-layer-diagram.png]]

*** Flow regions
[[./images/velocity-boundary-layer-flow-regions-diagram.png]]
- Viscous flow region
  The viscous effects and the velocity changes are significant in this region.

- Irrotational flow (inviscid flow) region:
  The viscous effects are negligible compared to inertial or pressure forces in this region, and the velocity remains essentially constant. These regions are usually regions that are not close to solid surfaces.

** Fluid viscosity (\(\mu\))
- Fluid viscosity is a measure of the internal stickiness of the fluid.
- It is responsible for the *no-slip condition* and the development of the boundary layer.

*** Dynamic viscosity (\(\mu\))
Dynamic viscosity is just the fluid's viscosity. It is in \(\unit{kg.m^{-1}.s^{-1}}\) or \(\unit{N.s.m^{-2}}\) or \(\unit{Pa.s}\)

- $\mu$ is the fluid's dynamic viscosity
- $\rho$ is the fluid's density

** Friction coefficient (\(C_f\))
- The friction coefficient (\(C_f\)) is directly related to the heat transfer coefficient and the power requirements of the pump or fan.
- Friction coefficient *varies* with distance along the surface.
- Friction force over the entire surface:
  \[F_f = C_f A_s \frac{\rho V^2}{2} \quad (\unit{N})\]

** Shear stress (\(\tau\))
Shear stress if the friction force per unit area. The shear stress for most fluids is proportional to the *velocity gradient*. For *Newtonian Fluids*, the shear stress at the *wall surface* is expressed as:
\[\tau_{w} = \mu \left. \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right|_{y=0} \quad (\unit{N.m^{-2}})\]

*** Wall shear stress (\(\tau_{w}\))
During flow, the fluid layer next to the surface will drag the plate along via friction (*surface drag*). The average wall shear stress is given by
\[\tau_{w} = C_f \frac{\rho V^2}{2} \quad (\unit{N.m^{-2}})\]

** 1, 2 and 3-dimensional flows
- A flow field is best characterised by its velocity distribution.
- A flow is said to be 1, 2, or 3-dimensional if the flow velocity varies in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions, respectively.
- However, the variation of velocity in certain directions can be small relative to the variation in other directions and can be ignored.

*** Turbulent flow
- Turbulent flow is highly disordered fluid motion that typically occurs at high velocities.
  [[./images/turbulent-flow-photo.png]]
- Velocity profile in turbulent flow is much *fuller* than laminar flow.
- Intense fluid mixing in turbulent flow as a result of rapid fluctuation (eddies) *enhances mass, heat and momentum transfer* between fluid particles compared to molecular diffusion in laminar flow.
- Eddies motion decreases rapidly near the wall due to the no-slip boundary condition, which results in *large velocity and temperature gradients*.

*** Transitional flow (not tested)
Transitional flow is a flow that alternates between being laminar and turbulent.
[[./images/transitional-flow-photo.png]]

** Reynolds number (\(Re\))
- The transition from laminar to turbulent flow depends on the *geometry, surface roughness, flow velocity, surface temperature, and type of fluid*.
- The flow regime depends mainly on the ratio of *inertial forces* to *viscous forces*, which is the Reynolds number.
  \[Re = \frac{\text{Inertial forces}}{\text{Viscous forces}} = \frac{V_{avg} L_c}{\nu} = \frac{\rho V_{avg} L_c}{\mu}\]

[[./images/reynolds-number-diagram.png]]

*** Critical Reynolds number (\(Re_{cr}\))

- For external flow over a flat plate, the flow is laminar when \(Re < 5 \times 10^5\)
- Flow is turbulent at \(5 \times 10^5 \le Re \le 10^7\)
- For internal flow in pipes, flow is laminar when \(Re < 2300\)
- Flow is fully turbulent at \(Re > 10,000\)

*** Large Reynolds numbers
The inertial forces are large relative to the viscous forces, and thus the viscous forces cannot prevent the random and rapid fluctuations of the fluid (*turbulent*).

*** Small or moderate Reynolds numbers
The viscous forces are large enough to suppress these fluctuations and to keep the fluid "in line" (*laminar*).

  \[Pr = \frac{\text{Molecular diffusivity of momentum}}{\text{Molecular diffusitivity of heat}} = \frac{\nu}{\alpha} = \frac{\mu c_p}{k}\]

- The Prandtl numbers of gases are about 1, which indicates that both momentum and heat dissipate through the fluid at about the same rate.
- Heat diffuses very quickly in liquid metals (\(Pr \ll 1\)) and very slowly in oils (\(Pr \gg 1\)) relative to momentum.

** Internal forced convection
- Internal forced convection refers to a fluid being forced to flow through pipes or ducts, and the wall of the pipe or duct is different from that of the fluid temperature, so *convection* heat transfer occurs between them.
- Circular pipes can withstand large pressure differences between the inside and the outside without undergoing any significant distortion.
- Circular pipes give the most heat transfer for the least pressure drop for a fixed surface area.
- Negligible frictional heating during flow, so the pressure drop is dominant.
- Significant fluid temperature change is due to heat transfer.

Where:
- $T_b$ is the bulk mean fluid temperature
- $T_{\text{m, i}}$ is the mean temperature at the inlet of the pipe
- $T_{\text{m, o}}$ is the mean temperature at the exit of the pipe

It is similar to $T_{film}$ in external flow over a flat plate.

** Average temperature
- In fluid flow, it is convenient to work with an *average or mean temperature* $T_m$, which remains constant at a cross-section.
- The mean temperature $T_m$ *changes in the flow direction* whenever the fluid is heated or cooled.

** Hydrodynamically fully developed flow

- The shape of the temperature profile remains unchanged in the fully developed region of a tube subjected to constant surface heat flux.

*** Constant surface temperature (\(T_s = \text{constant}\))
*Explanation:*
- Rate of heat transfer to or from a fluid flowing in a tube:
  \[\dot{Q} = hA_s \Delta T_{avg} = hA_s (T_s - T_m)_{avg} \quad (\unit{W})\]
- Two suitable ways of expression \(\Delta T_{avg}\):
  - Arithmetic mean temperature difference
    \[\frac{\Delta T_i + \Delta T_e}{2} = \frac{(T_s - T_i) + (T_s - T_e)}{2} = T_s - \frac{T_i + T_e}{2}\]
  - Logarithmic mean temperature difference
- By using arithmetic mean temperature difference, we assume that the mean fluid temperature varies linearly along the tube, which is hardly ever the case when \(T_s = \text{constant}\).
- This simple approximation often gives acceptable results, but not always, so we need a better way to evaluate \(\Delta T_{avg}\)

** Log mean temperature difference (\(\Delta T_{\ln}\))
The log mean temperature difference is the exact representation of the "average temperature difference" in the pipe between the fluid and surface, and used for calculating total convective heat transfer, where:
\[\dot{Q} = h A_s \Delta T_{\ln}\]
\[\Delta T_{\ln} = \frac{T_i - T_e}{\ln \frac{T_s - T_e}{T_s - T_i}} = \frac{\Delta T_e - \Delta T_i}{\ln \frac{\Delta T_e}{\Delta T_i}}\]

** Number of transfer units (\(NTU\))
The number of transfer unit is a measure of the effectiveness of the heat transfer systems.
\[NTU = \frac{h_L A_s}{\dot{m} c_p}\]
[[./images/number-of-transfer-units-diagram.png]]

For \(NTU = 5, T_e = T_s\), and the limit for heat transfer is reached.
- A small value of $NTU$ indicates more opportunities for heat transfer. This means there is more heat transfer as length increases.
- $NTU$ greater than 5 means that the limit for heat transfer is reached. This limit does not increase when the length is extended.

** Heat transfer coefficients for internal flow
- When the inlet and outlet temperatures of the flow are known, the average heat transfer coefficient can be calculated directly.
- However, the inlet and outlet conditions are not always known, heat transfer coefficients would have to be used.
- Fortunately, the local heat transfer coefficient for fully developed flow is constant along the length of the pipe.

\[\rho c_p u \frac{T_{x + dx} - T_x}{dx} = - \frac{1}{2 \pi r dx} \frac{\dot{Q}_{r + dr} - \dot{Q}_r}{dr}\]
\[u \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = - \frac{1}{2 \rho c_p \pi r dx} \frac{\partial \dot{Q}}{\partial r}\]
\[\frac{\partial \dot{Q}}{\partial r} = \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(-2k \pi r dx \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right) = - 2 \pi k dx \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right)\]
\[u \frac{dT}{dx} = \frac{\alpha}{r} \left(r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right), \quad \alpha = \frac{k}{\rho c_p}\]

The rate of net energy transfer to the control volume by mass flow is equal to the net rate of heat conduction in the radial direction.

*** Constant surface heat flux (laminar flow)
\[u \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = \frac{\alpha}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r \frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \right)\]

Substituting \(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = \frac{2 \dot{q}_s}{\rho V_{avg} c_p R}\) and \(u(r) = 2 V_{avg} \left(1 - \frac{r^2}{R^2} \right)\):
\[\frac{4 \dot{q}_s}{kR} \left(1 - \frac{r^2}{R^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r} \frac{d}{dr} \left(r \frac{dT}{dr} \right)\]
\[T = \frac{\dot{q}_s}{kR} \left(r^2 - \frac{r^4}{4R^2} \right) + C_1 r + C_2\]

Applying the boundary conditions \(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = 0\) at \(r = 0\) (because of symmetry) and \(T = T_s\) at \(r = R\):
\[T = T_s - \frac{\dot{q}_s R}{k} \left(\frac{3}{4} - \frac{r^2}{R^2} + \frac{r^4}{4R^4} \right)\]
\[T_m = T_s - \frac{11}{24} \frac{{q}_s R}{k}\]
\[\dot{q}_s = h(T_s - T_m)\]
\[h = \frac{24}{11} \frac{k}{R} = \frac{48}{11} \frac{k}{D} = 4.36 \frac{k}{D}\]
\[Nu = \frac{hD}{k} = 4.36\]

** Internal laminar flow
For fully developed flow with *uniform surface temperature*:
\[Nu_D = \frac{hD}{k} = 3.66\]

For fully developed flow with *uniform heat flux*:
\[Nu_D = \frac{hD}{k} = 4.36\]

- \(Nu\) does not depend on \(Re\) or \(Pr\).
- For faster heat transfer, constant heat flux condition should be used.

** Laminar flow in circular tube
- The thermal conductivity $k$ for use in the $Nu$ relations should be evaluated at the bulk mean fluid temperature.
- For laminar flow, the effect of surface roughness on the friction factor and the heat transfer coefficient is negligible.
- In laminar flow in a tube with constant surface temperature, both the *friction factor* and the *heat transfer coefficient* remain constant in the fully developed region.

** Heat transfer enhancement
- Tubes with rough surfaces have much higher heat transfer coefficients than tubes with smooth surfaces.
- Heat transfer in turbulent flow in a tube has been increased by as much as 400% by roughening the surface. Roughening the surface increases the *friction factor* and thus the *power requirement* for the pump or the fan.
- The convection heat transfer coefficient can also be increased be inducing pulsating flow by pulse generators, or by inducing swirl by inserting a twisted tape into a tube, or by inducing secondary flows by coiling the tube.

[[./images/heat-transfer-enhancement-diagram.png]]

** Radiation
- Radiation is emission of internal energy of the object.
- Energy emitted by matter in the form of electromagnetic waves (Maxwell) or photons (Planck).

** Radiation heat transfer
- Unlike conduction and convection, heat transfer by radiation can occur between 2 bodies separated by a colder medium.
- Radiation does not require the presence of a material medium, which means it can occur in a vacuum.
- Radiation heat transfer is the *fastest* (at the speed of light).
- All objects emit radiation.
- Any object that is greater than \(\qty{0}{K}\) will emit radiation.
- The type of electromagnetic radiation that is pertinent to heat transfer is *thermal radiation*.
- There are two phenomena to study radiation heat transfer:
  - Maxwell: Electromagnetic wave theory
  - Max Planck: Photon phenomenon

** Speed of propagation of a wave in a medium (\(c\))
\[c = \frac{c_0}{n}\]

Where:
- $c$ is the speed of propagation of a wave in the medium
- $c_0$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, \(2.9979 \times 10^8 \ \unit{m.s^{-1}}\)
- $n$ is the index of refraction of the medium. \(n = 1\) for air and most gases, \(n = 1.5\) for glass, and \(n = 1.33\) for water.

** Electromagnetic wave theory (Maxwell)
- Electromagnetic waves or electromagnetic radiation represents the energy emitted by matter as a result of energy transitions of molecules, atoms, and electrons of a substance.
- Electromagnetic waves transport energy just like other waves, and they are characterised by their frequency \(v\) or wavelength \(\lambda\)
- These two properties in a medium are related by:
  \[\lambda = \frac{c}{v}\]

  Where:
  - $c$ is the speed of propagation of a wave in that medium

** Photon phenomena (Max Planck)
- Photon phenomena allow electromagnetic radiation to be viewed as a collection of discrete packets of energy called photos or quanta.
- In this view, each photo of frequency $v$ is considered to have an energy of:
  \[e = hv = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\]

  Where:
  - $e$ is the energy of a photon
  - $h$ is Planck's constant, \(6.626069 \times 10^{-34} \ \unit{J.s}\)
  - $v$ is the frequency of the photon
  - $c$ is the speed of propagation of a wave in the medium
  - $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon

- The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength.

** Electromagnetic spectra
[[./images/electromagnetic-spectra.png]]

** Visible light
Visible light is simply the *visible* portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that lies between \(0.40\) and \(\qty{0.76}{\micro m}\)

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Thermal radiation
- Temperature is a measure of the strength of atoms', molecules' or electrons' activity at a microscopic level, and the *rate of thermal radiation increases with higher temperature*.
- Radiation is a volumetric phenomenon.
- For opaque solids, radiation is considered a surface phenomenon.
- Radiation depends on materials, surface properties and temperature.

[[./images/thermal-radiation-diagram.png]]

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Blackbody radiation
- Blackbody objects radiate *maximum* thermal radiation energy at any given temperature.
- It is an ideal emitter and an ideal absorber.
- Emits radiation uniformly in all directions (diffuse emitter).

[[./images/blackbody-radiation-diagram.png]]

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Planck's law
\[E_{b \lambda} = \frac{2 \pi \hslash c^2 \lambda^{-5}}{e^{\left(\frac{\hslash c}{\lambda k T} \right)^{-1}}} \quad (\unit{W.m^{-2}.\micro m^{-1}})\]

Where:
- $E_{b \lambda}$ is the spectral blackbody emissive power. The subscript $b$ denotes a black-body and the subscript $\lambda$ shows that the parameter is wavelength dependent.
- $\hslash$ is Planck's constant, \(6.626069 \times 10^{-34} \ \unit{J.s}\)
- $c$ is the speed of propagation of a wave in the medium
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the thermal radiation
- $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, \(1.381 \times 10^{-23} \ \unit{J.K^{-1}}\)
- $T$ is the temperature of the black-body

** Wien's displacement law
Wien's displacement law relates the peak spectral blackbody emissive power (\(E_{b \lambda}\)) with the temperature and wavelength.

\[(\lambda T)_{\text{max power}} = \qty{2897.8}{\micro m.K}\]

Where:
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light
- $T$ is the temperature of the body

*** Observations
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 25em
[[./images/wiens-displacement-law-diagram.png]]
- The emitted radiation is a continuous function of *wavelength*. At any specified temperature, it increases with wavelength, reaches a peak, and then decreases with increasing wavelength.
- At any wavelength, the amount of emitted radiation *increases* with increasing temperature.
- As temperature increases, the curves shift to the left to the shorter wavelength region. Consequently, a larger fraction of the radiation is emitted at *shorter wavelengths* at higher temperatures.
- The radiation emitted by the *sun* which is considered to be a blackbody at \(\qty{5780}{K}\), reaches its peak in the visible region of the spectrum. Therefore, the sun is in tun with our eyes.
- On the other hand, surfaces at \(T < \qty{800}{K}\) emit almost entirely in the infrared region and thus are not visible to the eye unless they reflect radiation coming from other sources.

** Total blackbody emissive power (\(E_b\))
The area under the curve of a graph of spectral blackbody emissive power (\(E_{b \lambda}\)) against the wavelength of the radiation (\(\lambda\)), indicates the total quantity of the radiant energy of all the wavelengths emitted by the body.

[[./images/total-blackbody-emissive-power-graph.png]]

\[E_b (T) = \int_0^{\infty} E_{b \lambda} (\lambda, T) \, d \lambda\]

Where:
- $E_b$ is the total blackbody emissive power
- $T$ is the temperature in \(\unit{K}\)
- $E_{b \lambda}$ is the spectral blackbody emissive power
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation

** Stefan-Boltzmann law
The Stefan-Boltzmann law may be derived from the total blackbody emissive power, i.e.

\[E_b (T) = \int_0^{\infty} E_{b \lambda} (\lambda, T) \, d \lambda\]
\[E_b (T) = \sigma T^4 \quad (\unit{W.m^{-2}})\]

Where:
- $E_b$ is the total blackbody emissive power
- $T$ is the temperature in \(\unit{K}\)
- $E_{b \lambda}$ is the spectral blackbody emissive power
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation
- $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant \(5.67 \times 10^{-8} \ \unit{W.m^{-2}.K^{-4}}\)

** Emissivity (\(\varepsilon\))
- Emissivity is the ratio of the radiation emitted by the surface at a given temperature to the radiation emitted by a blackbody at the same temperature. \(0 \le \varepsilon \le 1\)
- Emissivity is a measure of how closely a surface approximates a blackbody \(\varepsilon = 1\).
- The emissivity of a real surface varies with the *surface temperature*, *wavelength* and the *direction* of the emitted radiation.
- Spectral emissivity \(\varepsilon_{\lambda}\) is the emissivity at a specified wavelength.
- Directional emissivity \(\varepsilon_{\theta}\) is the emissivity in a specified direction.

*** Emissivity of a real surface
\[\varepsilon_{\theta} \ne \text{constant}\]
\[\varepsilon_{\lambda} \ne \text{constant}\]

*** Emissivity of a diffuse surface
\[\varepsilon_{\theta} = \text{constant}\]

*** Emissivity of a gray surface
\[\varepsilon_{\lambda} = \text{constant}\]

*** Emissivity of a diffuse and gray surface
\[\varepsilon = \varepsilon_{\lambda} = \varepsilon_{\theta} = \text{constant}\]

*** Emissivity of various materials
[[./images/emissivity-of-various-materials-table.png]]
[[./images/emissivity-of-various-materials-graph.png]]

In radiation analysis, it is common practice to assume the surfaces to be diffuse emitters with an emissivity equal to the value in the normal (\(\theta = 0\)) direction.

** Gray and diffuse surfaces
- A surface is said to be *diffuse* if its properties are *independent of direction*, and *gray* if its properties are *independent of wavelength*.
- The *gray* and *diffuse* approximations are often utilised in radiation calculations.

[[./images/gray-and-diffuse-surfaces-graph.png]]

*** Spectral directional emissivity
\[\varepsilon_{\lambda, \ \theta} (\lambda, \theta, \phi, T)\]

*** Total hemispherical emissivity
\[\varepsilon (T) = \frac{E(T)}{E_b(T)}\]

Where:
- $\varepsilon$ is the emissivity at a given temperature \(T\)
- $E$ is the total emissive power of the body at a given temperature \(T\)
- $E$ is the total blackbody emissive power at a given temperature \(T\)

** Black and non-blackbody radiation
- Relationship between the blackbody radiation rate (\(Q_b\)) and the total emissive power (\(E_b\)):
  \begin{align*}
  E_b (T) &= \sigma T^4 \quad & (\unit{W.m^{-2}}) \\
  Q_b (T) &= AE_b (T) = A \sigma T^4 \quad & (\unit{W})
  \end{align*}

*** Non-black surfaces
- The radiation is reduced by a fraction of $\varepsilon$, where \(0 < \varepsilon \le 1\), i.e.

  \[E(T) = \varepsilon E_b (T) = \varepsilon \sigma T^4 \quad (\unit{W.m^{-2}})\]

  Where:
  - $\varepsilon$ shows how well a surface can emit radiation
- Shiny surfaces have *low* \(\varepsilon\), while dull surfaces have *high* \(\varepsilon\).

** Radiation properties
[[./images/radiation-properties.png]]

Where:
- $I$ is the incidence wave intensity
- $I_r$ is the reflected radiation
- $I_a$ is the absorbed radiation
- $I_t$ is the transmitted radiation

*** Absorptivity (\(\alpha\))
\[\alpha = \frac{I_a}{I}\]

*** Transmissivity (\(\tau\))
\[\tau = \frac{I_t}{I}\]

*** Reflectivity (\(\rho\))
\[\rho = \frac{I_r}{I}\]

*** Relationship between the radiation properties
\[\frac{I_a}{I} + \frac{I_t}{I} + \frac{I_r}{I} = 1\]
\[\alpha + \tau + \rho = 1\]

For opaque surfaces, \(\tau = 0\),
\[\alpha + \rho = 1\]

Note that these definitions are for total hemispherical properties, so \(\alpha, \tau\) and \(\rho\) are average values.

** Reflection types
There are two extreme cases of reflection behaviour, specular reflection and diffused reflection. Real surfaces show some of both characteristics.

*** Specular reflection
Specular reflection occurs on *mirror like* surfaces, where the incident radiation is not dispersed.
[[./images/specular-reflection-diagram.png]]

*** Diffused reflection
Diffused reflection occurs on *rough* or *uneven* surfaces, where the reflected waves are equal in intensity and are reflected in all directions.
[[./images/diffused-reflection-diagram.png]]

** Non-black bodies
- Most real world objects are non-black bodies.
- Radiation is reflected, and only certain wavelengths are absorbed.
- This gives rise to an object's appearance.

[[./images/non-black-bodies-diagram.png]]

** Kirchhoff's law
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 10em
[[./images/kirchhoffs-law-diagram.png]]
- A small object (non-blackbody) in *thermal equilibrium* with a large enclosure at a constant $T$.
- The large enclosure behaves like a blackbody.
- Radiation flux incident (irradiation) on the small object is:
  \[G = E_b = \sigma T^4\]
- Radiation absorbed by the small object is:
  \[\alpha G = \alpha \sigma T^4\]
- Radiation emitted by the small object is:
  \[\varepsilon E_b = \varepsilon \sigma T^4\]
- For thermal equilibrium (net heat transfer \( = 0\)):
  \[\text{Radiation absorbed} = \text{Radiation emitted}\]
  \[\alpha \sigma T^4 = \varepsilon \sigma T^4\]
  \[\varepsilon = \alpha\]
- For opaque surfaces (\(\tau = 0\)), reflectivity \(\rho = 1 - \alpha\):
  - All properties of an opaque surface can be determined when one property is known.
  - Assumption is object surface temperature *is equal* to the irradiation source temperature.
  - Kirchhoff's law also gives acceptable results for situations where temperatures are different, *except when the surface temperature and the temperature of the source of incident radiation differ considerably.*

** View factor (\(F_{i-j}\))
[[./images/view-factor-diagram.png]]
- Radiation heat transfer depends on:
  - Relative surface orientation
  - Radiation properties
  - Temperature
- View factor is a geometric quantity that accounts for the effects of *surface orientation*.
- It is independent of surface properties and temperature.
- It assumes that surfaces are *diffuse emitters or reflectors*.
- It is useful in radiation analysis to express the *fraction of radiation* leaving a surface to strike another surface based on orientation.

*** Example
[[./images/view-factor-diagram-with-explanation.png]]

\(F_{1-2}\): The fraction of energy from surface 1 that reaches surface 2.
- \(F_{1-2} \le 1\).
- The view factor ranges between 0 and 1.
- View factor *does not* mean radiation absorbed by the surface.
- View factor *does not* consider reflections from other surfaces.

*** Hemisphere example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 30em
[[./images/view-factor-hemisphere-example-diagram.png]]
- Surface 1: Outer sphere surface
- Surface 2: Inner hemisphere surface
\[F_{1-2} = 0.5\]

- An object with surface 1 is placed in an enclosure with inner surfaces (including cover) designated as surface 2.
\[F_{1-2} = 1\]
\[F_{2-1} \ll 1\]
\[F_{2-2} \ne 0\]
\[F_{1-1} = 0\]

*** Meaning of \(F_{i-i}\)
- \(F_{i-i}\) is the fraction of radiation energy leaving surface $i$ that strikes itself directly.
- \(F_{i-i} = 0\) for flat or convex surface, but is non-zero for concave surfaces.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 30em
[[./images/view-factor-for-surface-striking-itself.png]]

*** Assumptions
- The radiation coming off the source is *uniform* in all directions.
- The medium does not *absorb, emit, or scatter* radiation.
- It is valid for isothermal and *diffuse emitters or reflectors* and in air or vacuum.

*** Definition
The *view* factor between two surfaces 1 and 2 having areas \(A_1\) and \(A_2\), is the fraction of the radiation leaving surface 1 that is intercepted by surface 2.
[[./images/view-factor-surfaces-a1-and-a2-diagram.png]]
\[F_{1-2} = \frac{\text{Energy leaving $A_1$ and intercepted by $A_2$}}{\text{Total energy leaving $A_1$}}\]

- \(F_{1-2} = 0\) means that surface 2 cannot be "seen" by surface 1
- \(F_{1-2} = 1\) means that surface 2 completely blocks the view of surface 1

** Radiation exchange between black surfaces
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 25em
[[./images/radiation-exchange-between-black-surfaces-diagram.png]]
Consider these two black surfaces, the view factor from surface 1 to 2 is \(F_{1-2}\).
- The thermal radiation emitted by black surface 1 is \(E_{b1} = \sigma T_1^4 \quad (\unit{W.m^{-2}})\)
- The heat rate emitted is \(Q = A_1 E_{b1} = A_1 \sigma T_1^4 \quad (\unit{W})\)
- The amount of thermal radiation from surface 1 that *arrives* at surface 2 is \(Q_{1-2} = F_{1-2} A_1 \sigma T_1^4\)
- Similarly, the amount of thermal radiation from surface 2 that arrives at surface 1 is \(Q_{2-1} = F_{2-1} A_2 \sigma T_2^4\)
- Hence, the net radiation exchange, which is the net heat transfer from surface 1 to 2 is:
  \begin{align*}
  Q_{1-2} &= Q_{1-2} - Q_{2-1} \\
  &= F_{1-2} A_1 \sigma T_1^4 - F_{2-1} A_2 \sigma T_2^4 \\
  &= F_{1-2} A_1 \sigma \left(T_1^4 - T_2^4 \right)
  \end{align*}

** Radiation exchange within large enclosure
Radiation heat transfer from *a non-black surface placed in a large enclosure* (only valid for \(F_{1-2} = 1\)):

\begin{align*}
Q_{1-2} &= \varepsilon F_{1-2} A_1 \sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4) \\
&= \varepsilon A_1 \sigma (T_1^4 - T_1^4) \\
\end{align*}

Because:
- \(F_{1-2} = 1\)
- \(\varepsilon = \text{emissivity}\), \(0 < \varepsilon \le 1\)

\[\dot{Q}_{rad} = \varepsilon \sigma A_s (T_s^4 - T_{surr}^4) \quad (\unit{W})\]

Where:
- $\dot{Q}_{rad}$ is the heat transfer due to radiation
- $\varepsilon$ is the emissivity of the surface
- $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (\(5.670 \times 10^{-8} \ \unit{W.m^{-2}.K^{-4}}\))
- $A_s$ is the surface area of the surface
- $T_s$ is the surface temperature
- $T_{surr}$ is the temperature of the surroundings

** View factor relations
- Radiation analysis on an enclosure consisting of $N$ surfaces requires the evaluation of $N^2$ view factors.
- Once a sufficient number of view factors are available, the rest of them can be determined by utilising some fundamental relations for view factors.
- The relations are:
  1. The reciprocity relation
  2. The summation rule
  3. The superposition rule
  4. The symmetry rule

** The reciprocity relation
View factors \(F_{i-j}\) and \(F_{j-i}\) are not equal to each other unless the areas of the two surfaces, \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) are equal.
\[A_i F_{i-j} = A_j F_{j-i}\]

For example:
[[./images/view-factor-surfaces-a1-and-a2-diagram.png]]
\[A_1 F_{1-2} = A_2 F_{2-1}\]

When determining view factors, you should evaluate the easier one directly, then use the reciprocity relation to get the more difficult one.

The view factor from surface \(\boldsymbol{i}\) to surface \(\boldsymbol{j}\) (contains \(\boldsymbol{n}\) parts of \(\boldsymbol{j}\)) is equal to the sum of the view factors from \(\boldsymbol{i}\) to all the parts of surface \(\boldsymbol{j}\), i.e. for \(\boldsymbol{n}\) parts of \(\boldsymbol{j}\):
\[F_{i-j} = F_{i-j1} + F_{i-j2} + \ldots + F_{i-jn}\]

But note that:
\[F_{j-i} = F_{j1-i} + F_{j2-i} + \ldots + F_{jn-i}\]

There are many cases whereby the view factor cannot be determined directly. It is possible to express the area or area differences and then apply the superposition rule.

*** Example 1
[[./images/superposition-rule-example-1-diagram.png]]
\[A_2 = A_3 + A_4\]
\[F_{1-2} = F_{1-(3, 4)} = F_{1-3} + F_{1-4}\]

Multiply by \(A_1\):
\[A_1 F_{1-2} = A_1 F_{1-(3, 4)} = A_1 F_{1-3} + A_1 F_{1-4}\]

Using reciprocity relation:
\[A_2 F_{2-1} = A_{(3, 4)} F_{(3, 4)-1} = A_3 F_{3-1} + A_4 F_{4-1}\]

Note that:
\[F_{(3, 4)-1} \ne F_{3-1} + F_{4-1}\]
