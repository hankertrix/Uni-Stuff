* Definitions

** Scalars
Scalars are quantities that are fully described by a *magnitude* (or numerical value) alone, like mass, length, time, and energy.

** Vectors
Vectors are quantities that are fully described by both a *magnitude* and a *direction*, like displacement, velocity and acceleration.

** Rectilinear motion
Rectilinear motion is defined as the motion of a particle along a straight line.

** Position coordinates
The position coordinates is the coordinates that wholly defines the position of a particle, usually from an origin.

** Reference frames
Reference frames are the frames in which a coordinate system is created to determine an object's motion.

*** Absolute reference frame
The absolute reference frame is the frame that never moves. In other words, it is glued to the ground and does not translate or rotate as the ground never moves.

*** Point-attached reference frame
Point-attached reference frames are reference frames that are attached to a point on an object or body. These reference frames never rotate, only translate. The origin of the reference frame is the point the reference frame is attached to. In other words, the origin of a point-attached reference frame is glued to a point on an object or a body, and since a point cannot be rotated, the reference frame likewise also cannot be rotated, only translated.

*** Body-attached reference frame
Body-attached reference frames are reference frames where the reference frame is attached to an object or body. The reference frame can be thought of as being glued to an object or body. Such reference frames can both translate and rotate, as they follow the body's motion.

** Velocity (\(v\))
The velocity of a particle is equal to the time derivative of the particle's position (\(x\)), i.e.
\[v = \frac{dx}{dt}\]

Where:
- $v$ is the velocity of the particle
- $\frac{dx}{dt}$ is the derivative of the position of the particle with respect to time

** Acceleration (\(a\))
The acceleration of a particle is obtained by differentiating the particle's velocity (\(v\)) with respect to time, i.e.
\[a = \frac{dv}{dt}\]
\[a = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\]
\[a = v \frac{dv}{dx}\]

Where:
- $a$ is the acceleration of the particle
- $\frac{dv}{dt}$ is the derivative of the velocity of the particle with respect to time
- $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$ is the second derivative of the position of the particle with respect to time
- $v$ is the velocity of the particle
- $\frac{dv}{dx}$ is the derivative of the velocity of the particle with respect to its position

** Curvilinear motion
[[./images/curvilinear-motion-of-particle.png]]

The curvilinear motion of a particle involves particle motion along a curved path. The position $P$ of the particle at a given time is defined by the position vector $\vec{r}$ joining the origin $O$ of the coordinate system with the point $P$.

** Velocity of a particle in curvilinear motion (\(\vec{v}\))
[[./images/curvilinear-motion-of-particle.png]]

The velocity \(\vec{v}\) of the particle is defined by the relation:
\[\vec{v} = \frac{d \vec{r}}{dt}\]

The velocity vector is tangent to the path of the particle, and has a magnitude $v$ equal to the time derivative of the length $s$ of the arc described by the particle:
\[v = \frac{ds}{dt}\]

** Instantaneous velocity of a particle in curvilinear motion (\(\vec{v}_{instant}\))

** Acceleration of a particle in curvilinear motion (\(\vec{a}\))
In general, the acceleration $\vec{a}$ of the particle is not tangent to the *path of the particle*. It is defined by the relation:

The instantaneous acceleration is the limit of the average acceleration \(\frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}\), as $\Delta t$ approaches 0.
- The magnitude of the velocity vector may change.
- The direction of the velocity vector may change, even if the magnitude remains constant.

** Rectangular coordinate system
Denoting $x, y$ and $z$ as the rectangular coordinates of a particle $P$, the rectangular components of velocity and acceleration of $P$ are equal to the first and second derivatives with respect to $t$ of the corresponding coordinates:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
$v_x = \dot{x}$ & $v_y = \dot{y}$ & $v_z = \dot{z}$ \\
$a_x = \ddot{x}$ & $a_y = \ddot{y}$ & $a_z = \ddot{z}$

Entrained quantity is the quantity imparted into an object by another object that it is in contact with. This quantity is usually either velocity or acceleration, but could be other physical quantities as well. For example, a bead sliding down a rotating wire will have a sliding velocity, and a velocity imparted to it due to the rotation of the wire. This imparted velocity is called the entrained velocity.

*** Change in radial velocity direction
[[./images/change-in-radial-velocity-direction-coriolis-acceleration.png]]
- The first source is due to the interaction of the radial velocity of the sliding object and the angular velocity imparted on the object.
- While the magnitude of the radial velocity of the sliding object is constant, there is a change in the velocity's direction, which creates a tangential acceleration:

\[\vec{a}_t = \vec{\omega} \times \dot{r} \hat{e}_r = \dot{\theta} \dot{r} \hat{e}_{\theta}\]

- $\hat{e}_r$ is the unit vector parallel to the position vector of the object

*** Change in tangential velocity
#+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 0.62
[[./images/change-in-tangential-velocity-coriolis-acceleration.png]]
- The second source is due to the change in tangential velocity of the sliding object.
- The sliding object moves away from the centre of the circle it is rotating about.
- This causes the distance of the object from the circle to increase from $r$ to $r + \Delta r$.
- Since the object takes some time to move the distance $\Delta r$, there is also a change in time $\Delta t$.
- This means that the tangential velocity has increased by \(\frac{\Delta r}{\Delta t} \dot{\theta}\), which also means there is an acceleration equal to \(\frac{\Delta r}{\Delta t} \dot{\theta}\).
- Hence:

\[\vec{a}_t = \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta t} \dot{\theta} \hat{e}_{\theta} = \dot{r} \dot{\theta} \hat{e}_{\theta}\]

Where:
- $\vec{a}_t$ is the Coriolis acceleration that is tangential
- $\Delta r$ is change in position of the object

When particles $A$ and $B$ move along the same straight line, the *relative motion* of $B$ with respect to $A$ can be considered. Denoting the relative position coordinate of $B$ with respect to $A$ as $x_{B/A}$, we have:
\[x_B = x_A + x_{B/A}\]
\[v_B = v_A + v_{B/A}\]
\[a_B = a_A + a_{B/A}\]

Where:
- $v_{B/A}$ is the relative velocity of B with respect to A

*** Pulley system
When several blocks are connected by *inextensible cords*, it is possible to write a linear relation between their position coordinates. Similar relations can then be written between their velocities and accelerations and can be used to analyse their motion.

[[./images/pulley-system-diagram.png]]

Steps to solving pulley system problems:
1. Define the position coordinates of all the blocks that move. The coordinates are determined relative to a fixed point, which is the origin.
2. Set up the constraint equations by expressing the length of the strings in the pulley system using the position coordinates of all the points of interests (the blocks that move).
3. Use the simultaneous equations to solve.
4. Differentiate the position coordinates with respect to time to find velocity and acceleration if necessary.

** Two-dimensional relative motion
For two particles $A$ and $B$ moving in space, we consider the relative motion of $B$ with respect to $A$, or more precisely, with respect to a moving frame attached to $A$ and in translation with $A$. Denoting the relative position vector of $B$ with respect to $A$ as $\vec{r}_B$, we have:
\[\vec{r}_B = \vec{r}_A + \vec{r}_{B/A}\]
\[\vec{v}_B = \vec{v}_A + \vec{v}_{B/A}\]
\[\vec{a}_B = \vec{a}_A + \vec{a}_{B/A}\]

Where:
- $\vec{v}_{B/A}$ is the relative velocity of $B$ with respect to $A$
- $\vec{a}_{B/A}$ is the relative acceleration of $B$ with respect to $A$

* Vectors

** Notation
A vector ($a$, $b$) can be expressed in the form below, where $r$ is the magnitude of the angle and $\theta$ is the *anti-clockwise* angle from the *positive* \(x\)-axis:
\[\vec{r} = r \angle \theta\]

The magnitude $r$ of the vector is given by:
\[r = \left| \vec{r} \right| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\]

The angle $\theta$ is given by:
\[\theta = \arctan \left( \frac{b}{a} \right)\]

The vector can also be expressed as follows:
\begin{align*}
\vec{r} &= a \vec{i} + b \vec{j} \\
&= r \hat{e}_r \\
&= r \left( \cos \theta \vec{i} + \sin \theta \vec{j} \right) \quad \because \ \hat{e}_r = \cos \theta \vec{i} + \sin \theta \vec{j}
\end{align*}

*** \(\vec{r}\) notation
The $\vec{r}$ notation is notated opposite to the regular vector notation, so for a line $AB$, the vector is usually notated $\overrightarrow{AB}$, while in the $\vec{r}$ notation, it would be $\vec{r}_{BA}$. The $\vec{r}$ means "relative to", i.e. $\vec{r}_{BA}$ is the position vector of the first point ($B$) relative to the second point ($A$). The $O$ is omitted when the point is relative to the *origin*, so the position vector $\overrightarrow{OA}$ will be $\vec{r}_A$ in $\vec{r}$ notation.

** Dot product (Scalar product)
\[\vec{A} = a \vec{i} + b \vec{j}\]
\[\vec{B} = c \vec{i} + d \vec{j}\]
\begin{align*}
\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} &= \left( a \vec{i} + b \vec{j} \right) \cdot \left(c \vec{i} + d \vec{j} \right) \\
&= ac + bd
\end{align*}
\[\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = |\vec{A}| |\vec{B}| \cos \theta\]

Where:
- $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors

*** Physical meaning
- *Work* is the dot product of force and *displacement*.
- A force is said to do positive work if the force (when applied) has a component in the direction of the displacement.
- The dot product gives the projection of the first vector on the second vector.

** Cross product (Vector product)
\[\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = |\vec{A}| |\vec{B}| \sin \theta\]

Where:
- $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors

*** Directional vectors (\(\vec{i}, \vec{j}, \vec{k}\))
\[\vec{i} \times \vec{j} = \vec{k} \qquad \qquad \vec{j} \times \vec{i} = -\vec{k}\]
\[\vec{j} \times \vec{k} = \vec{i} \qquad \qquad \vec{k} \times \vec{j} = -\vec{i}\]
\[\vec{k} \times \vec{i} = \vec{j} \qquad \qquad \vec{i} \times \vec{k} = -\vec{i}\]

A tip to quickly figure out the direction of the vectors is to write the directional vectors out like shown below:
\begin{align*}
\text{Result is positive } (+) &: \quad \vec{i} \xrightarrow{\times} \vec{j} \xrightarrow{\times} \vec{k} \xrightarrow{\times} \vec{i} \\
\text{Result is negative } (-) &: \quad \vec{i} \xleftarrow{\times} \vec{j} \xleftarrow{\times} \vec{k} \xleftarrow{\times} \vec{i}
\end{align*}

* Figuring out the motion of objects relative to an attached frame of reference
1. Look at the length of the line with respect to the new origin of the attached frame of reference.
2. If the length of the line is constant, as in it doesn't change with time, then the motion of the object is likely a circular motion.
3. To confirm if the object is truly in circular motion, look at the angle the object makes with the origin of the attached frame.
4. This angle can be derived from the angle of the object with respect to the origin in the absolute frame.
5. If the angle is variable, as in it changes with time, then the object is circular motion.
6. Otherwise, if the angle is constant and doesn't change with time, then the object is not moving at all in the attached frame of reference.

* Determining the friction direction
1. Get the relative velocity of the object with respect to the other object that it is in contact with, and hence experiencing friction due to that contact.
2. The friction direction will always be opposite in direction to the obtained relative velocity.

* Steps to solve collision problems
1. Set coordinates of the direction parallel (\(\hat{e}_n\)) and perpendicular (\(\hat{e}_t\)) to the impact, i.e. express \(\hat{i}\) and \(\hat{j}\) in terms of \(\hat{e}_n\) and \(\hat{e}_t\).
2. Set the restitution equation in the direction parallel to the impact (\(\hat{e}_n\) direction).
3. The direction perpendicular to the impact (\(\hat{e}_t\) direction) has no net force, and hence there is no change in velocities in that direction.
4. Gravitational force is negligible during the collision as the impact forces are relatively large.
5. Analyse the directions of the impact force and constrains to find the direction in which the net force of the system is zero. Apply the conservation of linear momentum in that direction.

* Steps to solve pulley problems
1. Break down the system into individual objects.
2. Set the kinetic equation for each object.
   \[F = ma \quad \text{and} \quad M = I \alpha\]
3. Find the relationship between the accelerations, the work done, or the energies.
4. Solve all the equations.
