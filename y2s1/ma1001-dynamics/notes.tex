\subsection{Scalars}
\label{sec:org1f45394}
Scalars are quantities that are fully described by a \textbf{magnitude} (or numerical value) alone, like mass, length, time, and energy.
\subsection{Vectors}
\label{sec:orge306427}
Vectors are quantities that are fully described by both a \textbf{magnitude} and a \textbf{direction}, like displacement, velocity and acceleration.
\subsection{Rectilinear motion}
\label{sec:org1684a7d}
Rectilinear motion is defined as the motion of a particle along a straight line.
\subsection{Position coordinates}
\label{sec:org99c15d0}
The position coordinates is the coordinates that wholly defines the position of a particle, usually from an origin.
\subsection{Reference frames}
\label{sec:orgda1f4b0}
Reference frames are the frames in which a coordinate system is created to determine an object's motion.
\subsubsection{Absolute reference frame}
\label{sec:org0338a70}
The absolute reference frame is the frame that never moves. In other words, it is glued to the ground and does not translate or rotate as the ground never moves.
\subsubsection{Point-attached reference frame}
\label{sec:orgc0cbb17}
Point-attached reference frames are reference frames that are attached to a point on an object or body. These reference frames never rotate, only translate. The origin of the reference frame is the point the reference frame is attached to. In other words, the origin of a point-attached reference frame is glued to a point on an object or a body, and since a point cannot be rotated, the reference frame likewise also cannot be rotated, only translated.
\subsubsection{Body-attached reference frame}
\label{sec:org63b9c40}
Body-attached reference frames are reference frames where the reference frame is attached to an object or body. The reference frame can be thought of as being glued to an object or body. Such reference frames can both translate and rotate, as they follow the body's motion.
\subsection{Velocity (\(v\))}

\item \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) is the derivative of the position of the particle with respect to time
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Acceleration (\(a\))}
\label{sec:org7a2097e}
The acceleration of a particle is obtained by differentiating the particle's velocity (\(v\)) with respect to time, i.e.
\[a = \frac{dv}{dt}\]
\[a = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\]
\[a = v \frac{dv}{dx}\]

\label{sec:orgaee031a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Coriolis acceleration is the acceleration experienced or observed by objects which are moving relative to a rotating frame of reference.
\item The Coriolis acceleration comes from 2 sources, and together they make up the total Coriolis acceleration, which is:
\end{itemize}

\[\vec{a}_c = 2 \dot{r} \dot{\theta} \hat{e}_{\theta}\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\vec{a}_c\) is the Coriolis acceleration
\item \(\dot{r}\) is the rate of change of position of the sliding object, which is the magnitude of the radial velocity
\item \(\hat{e}_r\) is the unit vector parallel to the position vector of the object
\item \(\dot{\theta}\) is the rate of change of angular displacement, or the angular velocity
\item \(\hat{e}_{\theta}\) is the unit vector perpendicular to the position vector of the object, it is \(\hat{e}_r\) rotated \(90^{\circ}\) anti-clockwise
\end{itemize}

\label{sec:org0e6c3b6}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./images/change-in-radial-velocity-direction-coriolis-acceleration.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item The first source is due to the interaction of the radial velocity of the sliding object and the angular velocity imparted on the object.
\item While the magnitude of the radial velocity of the sliding object is constant, there is a change in the velocity's direction, which creates a tangential acceleration:
\end{itemize}

\[\vec{a}_t = \vec{\omega} \times \dot{r} \hat{e}_r = \dot{\theta} \dot{r} \hat{e}_{\theta}\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\vec{a}_t\) is the Coriolis acceleration that is tangential
\item \(\vec{\omega}\) is the angular velocity vector
\item \(\dot{r}\) is the rate of change of position of the sliding object, which is the magnitude of the radial velocity
\item \(\hat{e}_r\) is the unit vector parallel to the position vector of the object
\item \(\dot{\theta}\) is the rate of change of angular displacement, or the angular velocity
\item \(\hat{e}_{\theta}\) is the unit vector perpendicular to the position vector of the object, it is \(\hat{e}_r\) rotated \(90^{\circ}\) anti-clockwise
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Change in tangential velocity}
\label{sec:orge710085}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.62]{./images/change-in-tangential-velocity-coriolis-acceleration.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item The second source is due to the change in tangential velocity of the sliding object.
\item The sliding object moves away from the centre of the circle it is rotating about.
\item This causes the distance of the object from the circle to increase from \(r\) to \(r + \Delta r\).
\item Since the object takes some time to move the distance \(\Delta r\), there is also a change in time \(\Delta t\).
\item This means that the tangential velocity has increased by \(\frac{\Delta r}{\Delta t} \dot{\theta}\), which also means there is an acceleration equal to \(\frac{\Delta r}{\Delta t} \dot{\theta}\).
\item Hence:
\end{itemize}

\[\vec{a}_t = \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta t} \dot{\theta} \hat{e}_{\theta} = \dot{r} \dot{\theta} \hat{e}_{\theta}\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\vec{a}_t\) is the Coriolis acceleration that is tangential
\item \(\Delta r\) is change in position of the object
\item \(\Delta t\) is the change in time
\item \(\dot{\theta}\) is the rate of change of angular displacement, or the angular velocity
\item \(\hat{e}_{\theta}\) is the unit vector perpendicular to the position vector of the object, it is \(\hat{e}_r\) rotated \(90^{\circ}\) anti-clockwise

\end{center}

When particles \(A\) and \(B\) move along the same straight line, the \textbf{relative motion} of \(B\) with respect to \(A\) can be considered. Denoting the relative position coordinate of \(B\) with respect to \(A\) as \(x_{B/A}\), we have:
\[x_B = x_A + x_{B/A}\]
\[v_B = v_A + v_{B/A}\]
\[a_B = a_A + a_{B/A}\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(v_{B/A}\) is the relative velocity of B with respect to A

\subsubsection{Pulley system}
\label{sec:org68d4898}
When several blocks are connected by \textbf{inextensible cords}, it is possible to write a linear relation between their position coordinates. Similar relations can then be written between their velocities and accelerations and can be used to analyse their motion.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./images/pulley-system-diagram.png}
\end{center}

Steps to solving pulley system problems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define the position coordinates of all the blocks that move. The coordinates are determined relative to a fixed point, which is the origin.
\item Set up the constraint equations by expressing the length of the strings in the pulley system using the position coordinates of all the points of interests (the blocks that move).
\item Use the simultaneous equations to solve.
\item Differentiate the position coordinates with respect to time to find velocity and acceleration if necessary.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Two-dimensional relative motion}
\label{sec:org480c1ed}
For two particles \(A\) and \(B\) moving in space, we consider the relative motion of \(B\) with respect to \(A\), or more precisely, with respect to a moving frame attached to \(A\) and in translation with \(A\). Denoting the relative position vector of \(B\) with respect to \(A\) as \(\vec{r}_B\), we have:
\[\vec{r}_B = \vec{r}_A + \vec{r}_{B/A}\]
\[\vec{v}_B = \vec{v}_A + \vec{v}_{B/A}\]
\[\vec{a}_B = \vec{a}_A + \vec{a}_{B/A}\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\vec{v}_{B/A}\) is the relative velocity of \(B\) with respect to \(A\)
\item \(\vec{a}_{B/A}\) is the relative acceleration of \(B\) with respect to \(A\)
\end{itemize}

\item Vector addition of these two effects, applied to \(B\), yields \(\vec{v}_B\)
\item \(\vec{v}_{B/A}\) represents the effect of circular motion about \(A\). It can be expressed by the cross product:
\[\vec{v}_{B/A} = \vec{\omega} \times \vec{r}_{B/A}\]

\section{Vectors}
\label{sec:orgd0e31ad}

\subsection{Notation}
\label{sec:org0f0f0e3}
A vector (\(a\), \(b\)) can be expressed in the form below, where \(r\) is the magnitude of the angle and \(\theta\) is the \textbf{anti-clockwise} angle from the \textbf{positive} \(x\)-axis:
\[\vec{r} = r \angle \theta\]

The magnitude \(r\) of the vector is given by:
\[r = \left| \vec{r} \right| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\]

The angle \(\theta\) is given by:
\[\theta = \arctan \left( \frac{b}{a} \right)\]

The vector can also be expressed as follows:
\begin{align*}
\vec{r} &= a \vec{i} + b \vec{j} \\
&= r \hat{e}_r \\
&= r \left( \cos \theta \vec{i} + \sin \theta \vec{j} \right) \quad \because \ \hat{e}_r = \cos \theta \vec{i} + \sin \theta \vec{j}
\end{align*}
\subsubsection{\(\vec{r}\) notation}
\label{sec:org647be44}
The \(\vec{r}\) notation is notated opposite to the regular vector notation, so for a line \(AB\), the vector is usually notated \(\overrightarrow{AB}\), while in the \(\vec{r}\) notation, it would be \(\vec{r}_{BA}\). The \(\vec{r}\) means "relative to", i.e. \(\vec{r}_{BA}\) is the position vector of the first point (\(B\)) relative to the second point (\(A\)). The \(O\) is omitted when the point is relative to the \textbf{origin}, so the position vector \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) will be \(\vec{r}_A\) in \(\vec{r}\) notation.

 \newpage
\subsection{Dot product (Scalar product)}
\label{sec:orga7a73ea}
\[\vec{A} = a \vec{i} + b \vec{j}\]
\[\vec{B} = c \vec{i} + d \vec{j}\]
\begin{align*}
\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} &= \left( a \vec{i} + b \vec{j} \right) \cdot \left(c \vec{i} + d \vec{j} \right) \\
&= ac + bd
\end{align*}
\[\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = |\vec{A}| |\vec{B}| \cos \theta\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\theta\) is the angle between the two vectors
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Physical meaning}
\label{sec:org035d67e}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Work} is the dot product of force and \textbf{displacement}.
\item A force is said to do positive work if the force (when applied) has a component in the direction of the displacement.
\item The dot product gives the projection of the first vector on the second vector.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Cross product (Vector product)}
\label{sec:org31e5642}
\[\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = |\vec{A}| |\vec{B}| \sin \theta\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\theta\) is the angle between the two vectors
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Directional vectors (\(\vec{i}, \vec{j}, \vec{k}\))}
\label{sec:orgdf02dd6}
\[\vec{i} \times \vec{j} = \vec{k} \qquad \qquad \vec{j} \times \vec{i} = -\vec{k}\]
\[\vec{j} \times \vec{k} = \vec{i} \qquad \qquad \vec{k} \times \vec{j} = -\vec{i}\]
\[\vec{k} \times \vec{i} = \vec{j} \qquad \qquad \vec{i} \times \vec{k} = -\vec{i}\]

A tip to quickly figure out the direction of the vectors is to write the directional vectors out like shown below:
\begin{align*}
\text{Result is positive } (+) &: \quad \vec{i} \xrightarrow{\times} \vec{j} \xrightarrow{\times} \vec{k} \xrightarrow{\times} \vec{i} \\
\text{Result is negative } (-) &: \quad \vec{i} \xleftarrow{\times} \vec{j} \xleftarrow{\times} \vec{k} \xleftarrow{\times} \vec{i}
\end{align*}

\section{Figuring out the motion of objects relative to an attached frame of reference}
\label{sec:org7cd5623}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Look at the length of the line with respect to the new origin of the attached frame of reference.
\item If the length of the line is constant, as in it doesn't change with time, then the motion of the object is likely a circular motion.
\item To confirm if the object is truly in circular motion, look at the angle the object makes with the origin of the attached frame.
\item This angle can be derived from the angle of the object with respect to the origin in the absolute frame.
\item If the angle is variable, as in it changes with time, then the object is circular motion.
\item Otherwise, if the angle is constant and doesn't change with time, then the object is not moving at all in the attached frame of reference.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Determining the friction direction}
\label{sec:org5e4bd6e}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Get the relative velocity of the object with respect to the other object that it is in contact with, and hence experiencing friction due to that contact.
\item The friction direction will always be opposite in direction to the obtained relative velocity.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Steps to solve collision problems}
\label{sec:org6129402}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set coordinates of the direction parallel (\(\hat{e}_n\)) and perpendicular (\(\hat{e}_t\)) to the impact, i.e. express \(\hat{i}\) and \(\hat{j}\) in terms of \(\hat{e}_n\) and \(\hat{e}_t\).
\item Set the restitution equation in the direction parallel to the impact (\(\hat{e}_n\) direction).
\item The direction perpendicular to the impact (\(\hat{e}_t\) direction) has no net force, and hence there is no change in velocities in that direction.
\item Gravitational force is negligible during the collision as the impact forces are relatively large.
\item Analyse the directions of the impact force and constrains to find the direction in which the net force of the system is zero. Apply the conservation of linear momentum in that direction.

\item Solve all the equations.
