  - Space shuttle
- Construction machinery
- Industry machinery
- Daily life devices
  - Umbrella
  - Exercise machines

** Mechanism
A mechanism is a component of a machine consisting of two or more solid members (moving elements) connected together by joints.

[[./images/mechanism-flow-chart.png]]

** Kinematics
Study of motions, (position, velocity and acceleration of points and angular position, velocity, and acceleration of rigid bodies) in mechanism without references to forces.

** Dynamics
Study of motions in mechanisms with exerted forces and torques.

** Kinematic analysis
Kinematic analysis is determining position, velocity, and acceleration of points in members of specific mechanisms.

You can use kinematic analysis to evaluate performance.

** Kinematic synthesis
Kinematic synthesis is determining geometry or dimensions of a mechanism to produce a desired set of position, velocity and acceleration.

You use kinematic synthesis to design something to meet requirements.

** Link
Link refers to one of the *rigid bodies* or members joined together to form a kinematic chain (linkage).

@@latex: \newpage@@

*** Degrees of freedom
The number of independent parameters specifies the *location and configuration* of a rigid link (body).

3 degrees of freedom for a plane:
[[./images/links-plane-degrees-of-freedom-image.png]]

6 degrees of freedom for a space:
[[./images/links-space-degrees-of-freedom-image.png]]

** Joint
Joint refers to the connections between links that permit relative movement.

*** Classification of joints
1. Motion (degree of freedom) between connected links:
   - Revolute joints: Revolution, measured by angles, 1 degree of freedom.
     [[./images/revolute-joint-image.png]]

   - Prismatic joints: Linear, measured by distance, 1 degree of freedom.
     [[./images/prismatic-joint-image.png]]

   Table:
   [[./images/types-of-joints-table.png]]

@@latex: \newpage@@

2. Nature of contact
   - Lower pairs: Surface contact between two links.
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :height 15em
     [[./images/lower-pair-joints-image.png]]

   - Higher pairs: Point or line contact between two links.
     [[./images/point-and-line-contact-image.png]]
     [[./images/higher-pair-joints-image.png]]

** Fixed link / Stationing link
- A fixed link or stationing link are links between two joints connected to a fixed point.
- All joints connected to a fixed point are connected to each other through a fixed link.

** Frame
A frame is a fixed or stationing link in a mechanism.

** Kinematic chains / linkages
An assembly of links and joints. It is also known as linkages.

*** Open loop linkages
For open loop linkages, the motion of the tip has no constraint. An example is a robot arm.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 15em
[[./images/open-loop-linkage-image.png]]

@@latex: \newpage@@

*** Closed loop linkages
For closed loop linkages, the motion of the links are constrained by the loop.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 15em
[[./images/closed-loop-linkage-image.png]]

** Planar linkages
Planar linkages are linkages where the motion of all members are along parallel planes (different layers of planes).

#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 20em
[[./images/planar-linkages-image.png]]

*** Revolute joints
The axes of rotation of revolute joints are normal to the plan.

*** Prismatic joint
The direction of sliding is parallel to the plane.

** Kinematic diagrams
A kinematic diagram is a simplified drawing or sketch of a mechanism showing:
- Types of links
- Types of joints
- Arrangement of links and joints
- Dimensions of links

It is the "skeleton" of the mechanism.

*** Types of links

*** Examples
- Vice-grip pliers

- V-engine

  [[./images/v-engine-kinematic-diagram.png]]
- Door hinge mechanism
  [[./images/door-hinge-kinematic-diagram.png]]

** Multiple joints
Multiple joints refer to joints that join 3 or more links. These joints need to be counted once more for every link after the second link.

*** Actual number of joints
The actual number of joints is given by the equation below:
\[\text{Actual number of joints} = \text{Number of links connected to joints } - 1\]

** Degrees of freedom (DoF) of linkages
- The degrees of freedom of linkages refers to the number of *independent* coordinates or parameters needed to specify the position of every link relative to the frame.
- Motion of connected links are constrained by the number and types of joints in the overall system.
- The degrees of freedom are always less than the number of joints.
- The degrees of freedom are *equal to the number of inputs* (motors, drivers, actuators) to control the mechanism.

[[./images/degrees-of-freedom-diagram.png]]

@@latex: \newpage@@

*** 2 DoF example
Pin-in-slot joints and fork joints have 2 degrees of freedom, 1 for rotation and 1 for rotation.

@@latex: \newpage@@

*** Equation
\[DF = 3(n_L - 1) - 2n'_J - n''_J\]

Where:
- $n_L$ is the number of links
- $n'_J$ is the number of 1-DoF joints (revolute and prismatic)
- $n''_J$ is the number of 2-DoF joints (round pin in a slot)

| $DF > 0$ | Mechanism (movable)         |
| /        | <                           |
| $DF = 0$ | Structure (no moving parts) |
| $DF < 0$ | Over-constrained structure  |

*** 4-bar linkage
Four-bar linkage mechanisms are the most frequently used (with either R-joint or P-joint).

[[./images/4-bar-linkage-example.png]]

\[n_L = 4 \quad n'_J = 4 \quad n''_J = 0\]

\begin{align*}
DF &= 3 (n_L - 1) - 2n'_J - n''_J \\
&= 3 (4 - 1) - 2 \times 4 \\
&= 1
\end{align*}

@@latex: \newpage@@

*** Multiple joints
\[DF = 3(n_L - 1) - 2n'_J - n''_J\]

[[./images/multiple-joints-image.png]]

** Naming convention
Naming conventions are based on input and output relations. A 4-bar linkage has 1 degree of freedom, thus there is one input and one output.

[[./images/naming-convention.png]]

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Kinematic inversion
Choosing different links in a mechanism to be the fixed link or reference frame will result in different motion characteristics.

[[./images/kinematic-inversion-diagram.png]]

** Crank
A crank is a link that rotates continuously.

** Condition to form a 4-bar linkage
\[L_{max} \le L_{min} + L_a + L_b\]

Where:
- $L_{max}$ is the length of the longest link
- $L_{min}$ is the length of the shortest link
- $L_a, L_b$ are the lengths of the other two links

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Grashof condition
[[./images/grashof-condition-linkage-image.png]]

For a planar 4-bar linkage, if the dimensions of links satisfy the below condition, it is called a *Grashof* linkage.
\[L_{max} + L_{min} \le L_a + L_b\]

Where:
- $L_{max}$ is the length of the longest link
- $L_{min}$ is the length of the shortest link
- $L_a, L_b$ are the lengths of the other two links @@latex: \\@@

Grashof linkages also have at least one link can rotate \(\qty{360}{\degree}\). @@latex: \\@@

If the linkage doesn't satisfy the condition above, the linkage is called a *non-Grashof* linkage.

@@latex: \newpage@@

*** Types of linkages
1. Crank-rocker linkage.
   - The shortest link is *next to the fixed link*.
   - The shortest link rotates \(\qty{360}{\degree}\).

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 1
   [[./images/crank-rocker-linkage-image.png]]

2. Drag-link linkage, also known double-crank linkage.
   - The shortest link is the *fixed link*.
   - Both input and output links rotate \(\qty{360}{\degree}\).

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 1
   [[./images/drag-link-linkage-image.png]]

   @@latex: \newpage@@

3. Double rocker linkage.
   - Shortest link is opposite the fixed link.
   - The coupler rotates \(\qty{360}{\degree}\).

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 1
   [[./images/double-rocker-linkage-image.png]]

4. Change-point linkage, also known as crossover-position linkage.
   - All links can be collinear.

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :scale 1
   [[./images/change-point-linkage-image.png]]

5. Triple rocker, which is a non-Grashof linkage.
   - None of the links makes a \(\qty{360}{\degree}\) rotation.

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Transmission angle (\(\phi\))
- The transmission angle is the angle between the coupler centreline and the output rocker centreline.

  #+ATTR_LATEX: :height 15em
  [[./images/transmission-angle-image.png]]
- A small transmission angle results in very small output torque on rocker but high bearing force at \(O_3\).
  [[./images/small-transmission-angle-image.png]]
- The usual range of transmission angles is \(\qty{40}{\degree} \le \phi \le \qty{140}{\degree}\).
- The optimal transmission angle is \(\qty{90}{\degree}\).
- The minimum and maximum transmission angle occur when the crank aligns with the fixed link.
  [[./images/minimum-and-maximum-transmission-angle.png]]

** Limiting position
- The limiting position occurs when the input link aligns with the coupler.
- It defines the range of motion of the output link geometrically.

[[./images/limiting-position-image.png]]

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Two external friction wheels
[[./images/two-external-friction-wheels.png]]
- Wheels are in perfect contact (no slip), instantaneous velocities at contact point, \(P\), should be the same for both wheels.
- We have:
  \[V_p = r_1 \omega_1 = r_2 \omega_2\]
- Hence:
  \[V_r = \frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1} = \frac{r_1}{r_2} \tag{1}\]

Where:
- $V_p$ is the velocity of the point of contact of both gears
- $r_1$ is the radius of one circle
- $\omega_1$ is the angular velocity of the circle
- $r_2$ is the radius of the other circle
- $\omega_2$ is the angular velocity of the other circle

** Two internal friction wheels
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 20em
[[./images/two-internal-friction-wheels.png]]
- For two internal wheels, equation (\(1\)) above still holds except that two wheels rotate in the same direction.

\[V_r = \frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1} = \frac{r_1}{r_2} \tag{1}\]

Where:
- $V_p$ is the velocity of the point of contact of both gears
- $r_1$ is the radius of one circle
- $\omega_1$ is the angular velocity of the circle
- $r_2$ is the radius of the other circle
- $\omega_2$ is the angular velocity of the other circle

** Gears
Gears are used to transmit power and displacement between shafts.

** Laws of gearing
[[./images/common-normal-at-point-of-contact.png]]
- To maintain constant angular velocity ratio, the shape (profile) of teeth of a gear requires that *a common normal* at the point of contact between two teeth always passes through a fixed point on the line of centres of the gears.
- This point is called the *pitch* point.
- When the fundamental law is satisfied, gears in mesh are said to produce *conjugate action*.
- The involute tooth profile provides this constant velocity ratio.

** Spur gear terminology
[[./images/spur-gear-terminology.png]]

*** Pitch circle
The pitch circle is the circle on a gear that corresponds to the contact point of a friction wheel.

*** Addendum circle
The addendum circle is the circle drawn through the top of the gear tooth, and its centre is at the gear centre.

*** Dedendum circle
The dedendum circle is the circle drawn through the bottom of the gear tooth, and its centre is at the gear centre.

@@latex: \newpage@@

*** Circular pitch
The circular pitch is the arc distance along the pitch circle from a point on one tooth to the corresponding point on the adjacent tooth of the gear.

\[p_c = \frac{\pi d_p}{N} = \pi m\]

Where:
- $p_c$ is the circular pitch
- $d_p$ is the pitch diameter of the gear, which is the diameter of the pitch circle on the gear
- $N$ is the number of teeth on the gear
- $m$ is the module of the gear

** Module (\(m\))
Module \(m\) in SI units is used to express the gear tooth size rather than the diametral pitch \(P\) used in US units.

\[m = \frac{d_p}{N}\]

Where:
- $m$ is the module of the gear, or the gear tooth size in millimetres (\(\unit{mm}\))
- $d_p$ is the pitch diameter of the gear, which is the diameter of the pitch circle on the gear
- $N$ is the number of teeth on the gear

*** Converting to diametral pitch (\(P\))
\[\frac{m}{25.4} = \frac{1}{P}\]

Where:
- $m$ is the module of the gear, or the gear tooth size in millimetres (\(\unit{mm}\))
- $P$ is the diametral pitch of the gear

** Radius in terms of module (\(r\))
\[r = \frac{mN}{2}\]

Where:
- $r$ is the radius of the pitch circle of the gear
- $m$ is the module of the gear
- $N$ is the number of teeth on the gear

** Tooth thickness in terms of module (\(t\))
\[t = \frac{\pi}{2} m\]

Where:
- $t$ is the tooth thickness
- $m$ is the module

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Base circle
[[./images/base-circle-diagram.png]]

*** Addendum (\(a\))
The addendum is the length of the top half of the gear tooth. It should be equal to the dedendum. It is equal to the module of the gear, i.e.

\[a = m\]

Where:
- $a$ is the addendum of the gear
- $m$ is the module of the gear

*** Dedendum
The dedendum is the length of the bottom half of the gear tooth. It should be equal to the addendum.

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Velocity ratio
- The velocity ratio is equal to the angular speed (\(\omega\)) of the follower or driven gear (\(\omega_2\)) divided by the angular speed of the driving gear (\(\omega_1\)), i.e.
  \[r_v = \frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1}\]
  Where:
  - $r_v$ is the velocity ratio
  - $\omega_2$ is the angular velocity of the follower or driven gear
  - $\omega_1$ is the angular velocity of the driving gear

- It can also be expressed in terms of the ratio of rounds per minutes (RPM), the pitch radii, and the number of gear teeth:
  \[r_v = \frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1} = \frac{RPM_2}{RPM_1} = \frac{r_1}{r_2} = \frac{N_1}{N_2}\]

** Centre distance
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 15em
[[./images/centre-distance-image.png]]
- The centre distance is the distance \(c\) shown in the image above.
- This distance represents the spacing between the centres of the shafts upon which the gears are mounted.

*** In terms of pitch diameter (\(d_p\))
\[c = \frac{d_{p1} + d_{p2}}{2}\]

Where:
- $c$ is the centre distance
- $d_{p1}$ is the pitch diameter of the first gear

\[c = \frac{N_1 + N_2}{2 P_d}\]

Where:
- $N_1$ is the number of teeth on the first gear
- $N_2$ is the number of teeth on the second gear

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Line of action
[[./images/gear-contact-geometry-diagram.png]]
- The red line in the image above is called the line of action because the contact points of two gears in mesh must lie along it.
- The force that one gear tooth exerts on the tooth of the meshing gear acts along the common normal, which is also the red line in the image above.
- Therefore, another name commonly given to the line of action is the pressure line.

** Pressure angle (\(\phi\))
[[./images/gear-contact-geometry-diagram.png]]
- The angle \(\phi\) between the line of action and the common tangent to the pitch circles of both gears is called the pressure angle.
- Most gears have a \(\qty{20}{\degree}\) or \(\qty{25}{\degree}\) pressure angle.
- Gears are designated by their pressure angles, but one has to be careful.
- Changes in the centre distance will result in changes in the pressure angle.

*** Relationship between base-circle radius and pitch-circle radius
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 25em
[[./images/relationship-between-base-circle-radius-and-pitch-circle-radius-diagram.png]]

One of the properties of an involute tooth profile is that the normal to the involute at any point of the curve is tangent to the base circle.

\[r_{b1} = r_1 \cos \phi\]
\[r_{b2} = r_2 \cos \phi\]

Where:
- $r_{b1}$ is the radius of the base circle for the first gear
- $r_1$ is the radius of pitch circle for the first gear
- $\phi$ is the pressure angle between the two gears
- $r_{b2}$ is the radius of the base circle for the second gear
- $r_2$ is the radius of pitch circle for the second gear

** Meshing conditions
For two gears to mesh, the following conditions are required:
- Pressure angle must be the same.
- Modules \(m\) (or diametral pitches \(P_d\)) must be the same.
- Gears must have the same addendum and dedendum.
- Tooth thickness must be equal to one-half the circular pitch.
- Gears must have the same circular pitch.

** Pinion
A pinion is the *smaller* gear in a pair of meshing gears, and is the driver gear.

** Base pitch
[[./images/base-pitch-diagram.png]]

The base pitch is the arc distance along the *base circle* from a point on one tooth to the corresponding point on the adjacent tooth of the gear.

*** In terms of module in SI units (\(m\))
\[p_b = m \pi \cos \phi\]

Where:
- $p_b$ is the base pitch of the gears
- $m$ is the module of the gears
- $\phi$ is the pressure angle between the two gears

@@latex: \newpage@@

*** In terms of diametral pitch in English units (\(P\))
\[p_b = \frac{\pi}{P} \cos \phi\]

Where:
- $p_b$ is the base pitch of the gears
- $P$ is the diametral pitch of the gears
- $\phi$ is the pressure angle between the two gears

** Contact ratio (\(C.R.\))

*** Diagram
[[./images/contact-ratio-diagram.png]]

*** Description
- The contact ratio is an indicator of the *average number of pairs of teeth* in contact.
- The contact ratio being equal to 1 (\(C.R. = 1\)) means that there is only one pair of teeth in contact.
\[C.R. = \frac{\sqrt{(r_2 + a_2)^2 - r_2^2 \cos^2 \phi} - r_2 \sin \phi}{p_b} + \frac{\sqrt{(r_1 + a_1)^2 - r_1^2 \cos^2 \phi} - r_1 \sin \phi}{p_b}\]
Where:
- \(C.R.\) is the contact ratio
- $r_2$ is the radius of pitch circle for the second gear
- $a_2$ is the addendum for the second gear
- $\phi$ is the pressure angle between the two gears
- $p_b$ is the base pitch of the gears

** Interference
[[./images/interference-diagram.png]]
- Involute gear teeth have involute profiles between the *base circle* and the *addendum circle*.
- Below the base circle, there is no involute profile.
- If contact between the two gears occurs below the base circle of one of the gears, interference is said to occur.

*** Avoiding interference
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 18em
[[./images/avoiding-interference-diagram.png]]

To avoid interference, the following conditions must be met:

\[r_1 + a_1 \le \sqrt{r_1^2 \cos^2 \phi + c^2 \sin^2 \phi}\]
\[r_2 + a_2 \le \sqrt{r_2^2 \cos^2 \phi + c^2 \sin^2 \phi}\]

Where:
- $r_1$ is the radius of the pitch circle of the first gear
- $a_1$ is the addendum of the first gear
- $\phi$ is the pressure angle between the two gears
- $r_2$ is the radius of the pitch circle of the second gear
- $a_2$ is the addendum of the second gear

For gear 2, the expression can be simplified to:
\[r_2 + a_2 \le O_2 D\]

Where:
- $r_2$ is the radius of the pitch circle of the second gear
- $a_2$ is the addendum of the second gear
- $O_2 D$ is the length defined in the diagram above

*** Interference of rack and pinion
[[./images/interference-of-rack-and-pinion-diagram.png]]
- The worst possible case for interference.
- If interference does not occur under this condition, it will never occur to the pinion when it meshes with a gear with the same or more teeth.
- To avoid interference between a pinion and a rack, the number of teeth on the pinion, \(N\), must satisfy the following condition.

\[N \ge \frac{2k}{\sin^2 \phi}\]

Where:
- $N$ is the number of teeth on the pinion
- $k$ is the addendum constant (in \(\unit{km}\))
- $\phi$ is the pressure angle between the rack and the pinion

*** Minimum number of teeth to avoid interference
[[./images/minimum-number-of-teeth-to-avoid-interference-table.png]]
- When a generation method is used in gear manufacturing, such as with a rack cutter, the interference problem will transform into an "undercutting" problem of removing materials in the interference regions, thus weakening the gear teeth.

*** Rules on sizes of pinion and gear (or rack)
1. For a given gear (\(N_G\)) or rack, there exists a minimum number of teeth for the pinion, \(N_P^*\), such that there is no interference if the pinion tooth number \(N_P \ge N_P^2\), and that interference occurs if \(N_P < N_P^*\).
2. For a given pinion (\(N_P\)), there exists a maximum number of teeth for the gear, \(N_G^*\), such that there is no interference if the gear tooth number \(N_G \le N_G^*\), and that interference occurs if \(N_G > N_G^*\).

Note that the "gear" and "pinion" refer to the larger and smaller parts of a (single-stage) gear transmission. Therefore, the relationship \(N_G > N_P\) always holds true.

** Idler
[[./images/idler-image.png]]

For the equations below:
- $n$ is the RPM of the gear
- $N$ is the number of teeth on the gear

*** For gears 1 and 2
\[\frac{n_2}{n_1} = - \frac{N_1}{N_2}\]

*** For gears 2 and 3
\[\frac{n_3}{n_2} = - \frac{N_2}{N_3}\]

*** For gears 1 and 3
\[\frac{n_3}{n_1} = \left(\frac{n_3}{n_2}\right) \left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right) = \left(-\frac{N_2}{N_3} \right) \left(-\frac{N_1}{N_2} \right) = \frac{N_1}{N_3}\]

** Reversing gear box
[[./images/reversing-gear-box-image.png]]
- Two idlers are used between the input and output gears to change the direction of the output on the fly.
- When the L-shaped arm is moved to the position shown in the right picture above, the input and output shafts will have opposite directions of rotation.

[[./images/double-stage-gear-reducer-image.png]]
- The general relationship between the output rotational speed to the input rotational speed is given by:
  \[\left|\frac{n_{output}}{n_{input}} \right| = \frac{\text{product of driving gear teeth}}{\text{product of driven gear teeth}}\]

  Where:
  - $n_{output}$ is the rotations per minute of the output gear
  - $n_{input}$ is the rotations per minute of the input gear

- For the double-stage gear reducer above, it is:
  \[\frac{n_4}{n_1} = \frac{N_1 N_3}{N_2 N_4}\]

- $r_2$ is the radius of gear 2 in the image above
- $r_3$ is the radius of gear 3 in the image above
- $r_4$ is the radius of gear 4 in the image above

** Gear reducer
One can ideally use two gears (single-stage gear transmission) to achieve the needed speed reduction, but due to size and cost constraints, multi-stage gear reducers are used.

*** Double-stage gear reducer
Velocity ratio:

\[\frac{n_4}{n_1} = \left(- \frac{N_1}{N_2} \right) \left(- \frac{N_3}{N_4} \right)\]

- $N_4$ is the number of teeth on the third gear

** Speed ratio of planetary gear trains
\[\frac{n_{output} - n_c}{n_{input} - n_c} = \pm \frac{\text{product of driving gear teeth}}{\text{product of driven gear teeth}}\]

Where:

Determine the mass moment of inertia of the assemly about its centre of mass \(G\) and point \(C\). The moment so finertia of the disk and the rod about their mass centres \(A\) and \(B\) are known to be \(I_A = \frac{1}{2} m_D r^2\) and \(I_B = \frac{1}{12} m_r L^2\) respectively.

- Centre of mass:
  Using point \(A\) as the origin, the centre of mass can be located as:
  \[r_{AG} = \frac{m_D r_{AA} + m_R + r_{AB}}{m_R + m_D}, \qquad r_{AA} = 0\]
  \[r_{AG} = \qty{0.15}{m}\]

- Mass moment of inertia about \(G\):
  Using the parallel axis theorem, the moment of inertia can be calculated as follows:
  \begin{align*}
  \text{Disk: } I_G^{disk} &= I_A + m_D r^2_{AG} \\
  &= \frac{1}{2} (5) (0.1)^2 \\
  &= \qty{0.1375}{kg.m^2} \\
  \text{Rod: } I_G^{rod} &= I_B + m_D r^2_{BG} \\
  &= \frac{1}{2} (3) (0.6)^2 + 3(0.25)^2 \\
  &= \qty{0.2775}{kg.m^2} \\
  I_G &= I_G^{disk} + I_G^{rod} \\
  &= \qty{0.415}{kg.m^2}
  \end{align*}

- Mass moment of inertia about \(C\):
  Similarly, we have:
  \begin{align*}
  I_C &= I_C^{disk} + I_C^{rod} \\
  &= I_G + (m_D + m_R) r_{CG}^2 \\
  &= \qty{2.835}{kg.m^2}
  \end{align*}

* Types of gears

** Spur gears and helical gears
[[./images/spur-and-helical-gears.png]]
- Spur and helical gears are normally used when the driver and the follower shafts are parallel. Helical gears provide smoother, quieter, and less-shock operation.
- The smaller gear in a pair of meshing gears is called a *pinion*.

** Pinion and rack
[[./images/pinion-and-rack.png]]
- A rack is a straight bar with gear teeth, and may be considered as a spur gear with an infinite radius.

** Bevel gears
[[./images/straight-and-spiral-bevel-gears.png]]
- Bevel gears are used when the driver and driven shafts' centreline intersect.

** Worm gears
[[./images/worm-gears.png]]
- Worm gears are used when the driver and driven shaft centreline are at 90 degrees.
- Worm gear (on the left) is a special helical gear (on the right).

"Hold" the carrier link (\(c\)), which is fixed, and rotate gear 1.

\[\frac{n_{2/c}}{n_{1/c}} = - \frac{N_1}{N_2}\]

Where:
- $n_{2/c}$ is the rotations per minute of gear 2 relative to the carrier link
- $n_{1/c}$ is the rotations per minute of gear 1 relative to the carrier link

* Getting the velocity ratio of a gear chain
The velocity ratio a gear chain is generally:
\[\frac{\text{Target gear velocity}}{\text{Driving gear velocity}} = \frac{\text{Number of driving gear teeth}}{\text{Number of driven gear teeth}}\]

- If there is a carrier, or the gear chain is a planetary gear chain, the velocity ratio will be relative to the carrier speed, so the velocity ratio equation must subtract the carrier speed term, \(- n_c\).
- When the gear interaction is between an external gear and another external gear, the gear teeth ratio must be *negative (-)*.
- When the gear interaction is between an external gear and another internal gear, the gear teeth ratio must be *positive (+)*.

* Vector loops

** Purpose of vector loop method
- Forming vector loop equations to describe geometric constraints of mechanism and solve kinematics analytically.
- Vector loop of displacement vectors.
\[r_1 + r_4 = r_2 + r_3\]

*** Velocity closure equation
\[\dot{r}_1 + \dot{r}_4 = \dot{r}_2 + \dot{r}_3\]

*** Acceleration closure equation
\[\ddot{r}_1 + \ddot{r}_4 = \ddot{r}_2 +\ddot{r}_3\]

** Forming vector loops
- Utilise links between revolute joints.
- Use position of prismatic joints.

[[./images/forming-vector-loops.png]]

** Position analysis
1. Set up a fixed reference frame (\(X-Y\)) as shown below.
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :height 13em
   [[./images/vector-loop-closure.png]]
2. Assign a vector (magnitude and direction) on every link member in the mechanism so that all the vectors form a closed loop or a vector polygon.
3. Write the vector loop closure equation for every independent loop.
4. Decompose the vector loop closure equation into the scalar equations along the directions of the coordinate axes of the reference frame, in this case, the $X$ and $Y$ directions. Note that in the planar mechanism analysis, one vector loop equation can be decomposed into 2 scalar equations; in the spatial mechanism analysis the number of scalar equations should be 3.
5. Derive the necessary constraint equations (for rolling contact case), if any.
6. Formulate a set of simultaneous equations based on the results of steps 4 and 5. The set of equations is called the displacement equations of the mechanism. Solve the displacement equations using appropriate methods to determine the position of all members in the mechanism.
7. Use the positions of the link members found in step 6 to find the position of other points of interest on the mechanism.

Note that in step 6, the displacement equations are usually non-linear trigonometric equations that can be solved by using trigonometry functions. In certain situations, the displacement equations become linear equations whereby methods in linear algebra can be used to obtain the solution.

*** Example
Given the lengths of all the links \(\boldsymbol{r}_0, \boldsymbol{r}_1, \boldsymbol{r}_2\) and \(\boldsymbol{r}_3\) and the input crank angle $\theta_1$, as shown below, use the vector loop method to determine the positions of links 2 and 3, i.e., \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\).
[[./images/vector-loop-position-analysis-example.png]]

1. Set up the coordinate axes of the reference frame as shown in the figure. Note that the reference frame is usually attached to the fixed link, not the moving links.
2. Define vectors as shown in the figure: \(\boldsymbol{r}_0 = \boldsymbol{\overrightarrow{O_1 O_2}}, \boldsymbol{r}_1 = \boldsymbol{\overrightarrow{O_1 A}}, \boldsymbol{r}_2 = \boldsymbol{\overrightarrow{AB}}\) and \(\boldsymbol{r}_3 = \boldsymbol{\overrightarrow{BO_2}}\). Since all joints are of the revolute type, the vectors are therefore defined between the centres of the joints. The magnitudes of the vectors represent the length of the links. The directions of the vectors can be defined in either way depending on the analysis. The angle \(\theta_i\) is used to represent the orientation of \(\boldsymbol{r}_i\) relative to \(X\)-axis. The angle \(\theta_i\) is measure in the *counter-clockwise* direction.
3. The vector loop equation is then \(-\boldsymbol{r}_0 + \boldsymbol{r}_1 + \boldsymbol{r}_2 + \boldsymbol{r}_3 = 0\). Note that the directions of the vectors in the equation follow the vector addition and subtraction principles. Geometrically, the equation represents a vector polygon.
4. By expressing \(x_i = r_i \cos \theta_i\) and \(y_i = \sin \theta_i\), where \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) are the components of \(\boldsymbol{r}_i\) along the $X$ and $Y$ directions, the following two scalar equations can be obtained:
   \[-r_0 \cos \theta_0 + r_1 \cos \theta_1 + r_2 \cos \theta_2 + r_3 \cos \theta_3 = 0\]
   \[-r_0 \sin \theta_0 + r_1 \sin \theta_1 + r_2 \sin \theta_2 + r_3 \sin \theta_3 = 0\]
5. There is no constraint equation since there is no rolling contact in the mechanism.
6. From the problem statement, there are only two unknowns $\theta_2$ and $\theta_3$ in the above scalar equations. Two scalar equations can solve for two unknowns exactly. \(\theta_0\) is a constant. If the direction of \(\boldsymbol{r}_0\) is aligned along the \(X\)-axis, then \(\theta_0 = 0\). The input \(\theta_1\) is also given.
7. Suppose that a point $C$ is located on the coupling link, and the position of $C$ is given by the vector \(\boldsymbol{r'}_2 = \boldsymbol{\overrightarrow{AC}}\). The angle between \(\boldsymbol{\overrightarrow{AB}}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\overrightarrow{AC}}\) is \(\alpha\), therefore, the direction of \(\boldsymbol{r'}\) is \(\theta'_2 = \theta_2 + \alpha\). The position of C with respect to the reference frame \(X-Y\) is thus:
   \[\boldsymbol{r}_c = \boldsymbol{r}_1 + \boldsymbol{r'}_2\]

   Decompose the above equation into $X$ and $Y$ components and use the result form step 6, the $X$ and $Y$ coordinates of point C can be obtained:
   \[X_c = r_1 \cos \theta_1 + r'_2 \cos \theta'_2 = r_1 \cos \theta_1 + r'_2 \cos (\theta_2 + \alpha)\]
   \[Y_c = r_1 \sin \theta_1 + r'_2 \sin \theta'_2 = r_1 \sin \theta_1 + r'_2 \sin (\theta_2 + \alpha)\]

For velocity and acceleration analysis, just different the equations above to obtain the velocity and acceleration equations.

** Location of the reference frame
- The reference frame (\(X-Y\)) can be located anywhere on the fixed link.
- The origin of the reference frame is usually attached to the centre of the pivot of the input link.
- The direction of the input pivot to the output pivot is chosen as the direction of the \(X\)-axis.
- As shown in the figure below, the \(X\)-axis is along the direction of the fixed link. In this way, a vector in \(-X\) direction can represent the fixed link. Thus, the vector has no \(Y\)-component and the displacement equations can be simplified.
- The location and orientation of the reference frame is chosen in a way to simplify the formulation of the displacement equations.

** Determination of the vectors
Rules:
1. The magnitudes or the angular orientations (\(\theta\)) of all vectors should contain the information of all mechanism variables for the position analysis.
2. The vectors should be defined properly to reduce the non-linearity of the displacement equations.

- The high pressures required for diesel fuel injection cause high contact stresses on the cam.
- A roller follower is used to reduce wear.
- Most cam-and-follower systems are designed to control a process, not to transmit significant power.

** Terminology

*** Rise
Rise means the follower is moving away from the cam centre.

*** Dwell
Dwell refers to the period when the follower is stationary.

*** Return
Return refers to the follower moving back towards the cam centre.

*** Cam profile
Cam profile is the shaped surface of the cam defining the follower motion.

*** Follower motion graph
The graph below illustrates rise, dwell and return.
[[./images/motion-of-a-follower-graph.png]]

** Types of motion
- Uniform motion (for very low speeds)
- Parabolic motion (for low or medium speeds)
- Simple harmonic motion (for medium speeds)
- Cycloidal motion (for high speed applications)
- General polynomial motion (for high speed applications)

** Uniform motion
\[\theta = \omega t\]
\[\text{Follower displacement: } s = C \theta = \frac{L}{\beta} \theta\]
\[\dot{\theta} = \frac{d \theta}{dt} = \omega\]
\[\dot{s} = \frac{L}{\beta} \dot{\theta}\]
\[\ddot{s} = \frac{L}{\beta} \ddot{\theta}\]

[[./images/follower-uniform-motion.png]]

The accelerations are infinite and the forces and large, so this kind of motion is only suitable for very slow speeds.

@@latex: \newpage@@

** Parabolic motion
Parabolic motion is usually made up of two parabolas. The equation is as follows:
\[s = C_0 + C_1 \theta + C_2 \theta^2\]

#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 14em
[[./images/parabolic-motion-graph.png]]

*** First parabola (from \(0 \le \theta \le \frac{\beta}{2}\))
- At \(\theta = 0\), the displacement \(s = 0\), so \(C_0 = 0\).
- If slope \(s' = 0\) at \(\theta = 0\), then \(C_1 = 0\).
- At \(\theta = \frac{\beta}{2}\), \(s = \frac{L}{2}\), then:
  \[C_2 = \frac{2L}{\beta^2}\]
  \[s = \frac{2L}{\beta^2} \theta^2\]

#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 14em
[[./images/parabolic-motion-first-parabola-graph.png]]

*** Second parabola
- At \(\theta = \frac{\beta}{2}\), the displacement is \(s = \frac{L}{2}\).
- At \(\theta = \beta\), \(s = L\) and \(s' = 0\), therefore:
  \[C_2 = \frac{2L}{\beta^2}\]
- Hence:
  \[C_0 = -L\]
  \[C_1 = \frac{4L}{\beta}\]
  \[C_2 = -\frac{2L}{\beta^2}\]
  \[s = -L + \frac{4L}{\beta} \theta - \frac{2L}{\beta^2} \theta^2\]

\[\text{Displacement: } s = \frac{L}{2} \left(1 - \cos \frac{\pi \theta}{\beta} \right)\]
\[\text{Velocity: } \dot{s} = \frac{\pi L \omega}{2 \beta} \sin \frac{\pi \theta}{\beta}\]

*** Avoiding any cusps in the offset profile
- When the radius of curvature \(\rho = 0\), a *cusp, or a sharp corner* occurs.
- When \(\rho < 0\), *a concave portion* of the profile occurs, which is unfavourable for a flat-faced follower.
- To avoid both problems, it is required that \(\rho > 0\) for the flat-faced follower.

For a flat-faced follower:
\[\text{Radius of curvature: } \rho = r_b + s + \frac{d^2 s}{d \theta^2}\]
\[r_b + s + \frac{d^2 s}{d \theta^2} > 0\]
\[r_b > - \left(s + \frac{d^2 s}{d \theta^2} \right)\]

Let \(Q = s + \frac{d^2 s}{d \theta^2}\), then:
\[r_b > -Q\]
\[r_b > [-Q]_{max}\]

[[./images/avoiding-cusps-and-concave-profile-diagram.png]]

*** Example
Determine the minimum allowable base-circle radius of a cam based only on the given harmonic return portion of a motion program. The angular range for the return is \(\pi \le \theta \le \frac{5 \pi}{3}\), with a span of \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\), and the lift, $L$, of the flat-faced follower is \(\qty{2}{cm}\).

The follower displacement is given by:
\[s = \frac{L}{2} \left[1 + \cos \left(\frac{\pi (\theta - \pi)}{\frac{2\pi}{3}} \right) \right] \text{ or } s = 1 + \cos [1.5 (\theta - \pi)]\]

Differentiating with respect to \(\theta\):
\[\frac{ds}{d \theta} = - 1.5 \sin [1.5 (\theta - \pi)]\]
\[\frac{d^2 s}{d \theta^2} = - 1.5^2 \cos [1.5 (\theta - \pi)]\]

Hence:
\[Q = s + \frac{d^2 s}{d \theta} = 1 + \cos [1.5 (\theta - \pi)] - 2.25 \cos [1.5(\theta - \pi)]\]
\[Q = 1 - 1.25 \cos [1.5(\theta - \pi)]\]
\[-Q = -1 + 1.25 \cos [1.5(\theta - \pi)]\]
\[[-Q]_{max} = 0.25\]

The condition \(r_b > [-Q]_{max}\) gives \(r_b > 0.25\), hence:
\[r_b > \qty{0.25}{cm}\]

* Static force analysis

** Steps
1. Free individual body or bodies.
2. Draw applied force and moments.
3. Draw *assumed* constraint forces.
4. Write the equilibrium equations for each free body. There is a total of \(3N\) equations for \(N\) bodies.
5. Solve the equations for unknowns.

** Drawing free body diagrams

*** Vector equations

\[\sum_j \vec{T}_j = 0\]

*** Scalar equations

\[\sum F_{iy} = 0\]
\[\sum T_j = 0\]

3 equations for each free body, which means \(3N\) equations for \(N\) bodies.

*** Convention for forces in free-body diagram
1. If the direction and magnitude are known, draw them accordingly.
2. If the line of action of the force is known, but th emagnitude is unknown, assume that the direction is along the line of action of the force.
3. If the action line is unknown, assume a \(x\)-component and a \(y\)-component.

\[F_1^x = F_1 \cos \theta_2 \qquad F_1^y = F_1 \sin \theta_2\]
\[T - F_1 \cos \theta_2 \overline{AO} \sin \theta_1 - F_1 \sin \theta_2 \overline{AO} \cos \theta_2 = 0\]
\[F_1 \overline{AO} (\sin \theta_1 \cos \theta_2 + \cos \theta_1 \sin \theta_2) = T\]

Applying equilibrium equations:
\[F_{cx} + F_{12x} + F_{32x} = 0 \tag{1}\]
\[F_{cy} + F_{12y} + F_{32y} - P = 0 \tag{2}\]

Summing moments about point \(O\):
\[2.84P - 0.71F_{32x} - 0.90F_{cx} - 0.22F_{cy} = 0 \tag{3}\]

Equations \((1) - (3)\) are a system of three equations with 6 unknowns.

From the figure above:
\[F_{cx} = F_c \cos (\qty{57}{\degree}) \qquad F_{cy} = F_c \sin (\qty{57}{\degree}) \tag{4}\]
\[F_{12x} = F_{12} \cos (\qty{38}{\degree}) \qquad F_{12y} = F_{12} \sin (\qty{38}{\degree}) \tag{5}\]
\[F_{32x} = F_{32} \cos (\qty{20}{\degree}) \qquad F_{32y} = F_{32} \sin (\qty{20}{\degree}) \tag{6}\]

Substituting equations \((4) - (6)\) into \((1) - (3)\):
\[0.545 F_c + 0.788 F_{12} + 0.940 F_{32} = 0\]
\[0.839 F_c + 0.616 F_{12} + 0.342 F_{32} - 2000 = 0\]
\[5680 - 0.667 F_{32} - 0.675 F_c = 0\]

Solving the above equations for the unknowns:
\[F_c = \qty{6595}{N} \qquad F_{12} = \qty{-6758}{N} \qquad F_{32} = \qty{1842}{N}\]

- The cylinder force \(F_c\) required for static equilibrium is \(\qty{6595}{N}\).
- The components of \(F_{12}\) act in the negative coordinate directions.
- Member 3 and the cylinder are acted on by compressive forces, whereas member 1 is in tension for the position analysed.

*** Solution
- Kinematics analysis:
  Letting \(\alpha\) be the angular acceleration of the rod, we have:

  \[\sum M_a = 0\]
  \[-mg \frac{L}{4} + m \frac{L}{4} \alpha \times \frac{L}{4} + I_G \alpha =0\]
  \[\alpha = \frac{12g}{7L}\]

  \[\sum F_x = 0\]
  \[F_{Ax} = 0\]

\[\vec{a}_C = - 70 \hat{i} \ (\unit{in.s^{-2}})\]

With the angular velocities and accelerations, the following quantities can be obtained:
\[\vec{a}_{G1x} = - 71.6 \hat{i} \ (\unit{in.s^{-2}}), \qquad \vec{a}_{G1y} = - 79.5 \hat{j} \ (\unit{in.s^{-2}})\]
