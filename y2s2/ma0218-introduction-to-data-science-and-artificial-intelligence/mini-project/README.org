* Preface
The entirety of the project is contained within the ~main.py~ Python file,
and that also includes the slides.
The project makes use of [[https://marimo.io/][Marimo]], an alternative
to the Jupyter notebook format, and makes use of its slides.
Thus, [[https://marimo.io/][Marimo]] is needed to display the slides and
run the notebook.
The data is also needed for the slides to display properly,
as the slides makes use of the data for its visualisations.

* Installing required software

** Marimo
To install [[https://marimo.io/][Marimo]] using ~pip~, run the command below:
#+begin_src shell
pip install marimo
#+end_src

If you are using [[https://www.anaconda.com/][Anaconda]],
run the command below to install [[https://marimo.io/][Marimo]]:
#+begin_src shell
conda install conda-forge::marimo
#+end_src

#+begin_export latex
\newpage
#+end_export

** Other required libraries
The project also makes use of the libraries
covered in the lectures, such as:
- [[https://numpy.org/][Numpy]]
- [[https://pandas.pydata.org/][Pandas]]
- [[https://matplotlib.org/][Matplotlib]]
- [[https://seaborn.pydata.org/][Seaborn]]
- [[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/][Scikit-Learn]]

If you are using a package manager like ~pip~, ~poetry~, ~pdm~ or ~uv~,
you can run the commands below to automatically install
the required packages.

- For ~pip~:
  #+begin_src shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  #+end_src

- For ~poetry~:
  #+begin_src shell
  poetry install
  #+end_src

- For ~pdm~:
  #+begin_src shell
  pdm install
  #+end_src

- For ~uv~:
  #+begin_src shell
  uv install
  #+end_src

#+begin_export latex
\newpage
#+end_export

* Running the notebook
To run the notebook, change to the directory
where you have downloaded the program,
making sure that the data file is also
in the same folder, and use the command below:
#+begin_src shell
marimo run main.py
#+end_src

[[https://marimo.io/][Marimo]] should automatically open your browser,
similar to how Jupyter would, and you should be
able to view the notebook in the browser as slides.

If you would like to see the code, instead of running
the above command, use the command below to view it
in a notebook format:

#+begin_src shell
marimo edit main.py
#+end_src
