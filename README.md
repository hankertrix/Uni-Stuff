# Uni Stuff

Hello! This is the repository where I am storing all of my
university related things, so you can find my lecture notes
and tutorial answers here.
Hopefully this resource will help you in your university journey!

My first year and first semester was in August 2023,
so my first academic year is AY2023/2024.

## How the repository is organised

This repository is first split into folders for each year and semester,
with year 1 semester 1 being in the `y1s1` folder and so on.
Inside those folders are more folders for each of the modules that
I am taking for the semester, with the course code as well as
the course name in the name of the folder.
Inside those folders you will find the topics for those modules.
Finally, inside those folders, you will find my notes and tutorials.

## What's the difference between a `cheat-sheet` and `notes`?

A cheat sheet refers to the reference material that is brought to
a final exam, usually a double-sided A4 cheat sheet that contains
formulas and important points for the exam.

Some older cheat sheets, like those in the `y1s1` folder
are summaries or truncated versions of the notes.

Notes are mostly compilations of the content within the lectures,
and usually can be studied as a standalone material.

## There are multiple files with the same name, which file should I view?

TLDR: You should be viewing the **PDF** file.
If there is no PDF file in the folder, then view the **org** file.

There are usually three files with three different file extensions,
one with the `.org` file extension, another with the `.tex` file extension,
and one with the `.pdf` file extension.
The `.org` file is the raw org mode document that I write to create the
PDF file, which usually contains a lot of LaTeX fragments.
You can edit this file with Emacs Org mode and then
export it to LaTeX as PDF file to edit the PDF file.
The `.tex` file is an intermediate file,
which is generated by the Org mode exporter when I export to LaTeX.
This `.tex` file is then processed by the LaTeX compiler
to generate a PDF file, which is the final result that you want to view.

---

If there are only two files, there will usually be a file with the `.pdf`
file extension and another file with either the `.tex` file extension,
the `.sba` file extension, the `.typ` file extension,
or the `.svgz` file extension.
You should be viewing the file with the `.pdf`
file extension, unless you are looking to edit the PDF file.

The `.tex` file in this situation is handwritten LaTeX,
and is not generated by the Org mode exporter.
You can edit this `.tex` file and re-compile it to edit the PDF file.

The `.sba` file is the proprietary export file format,
called [Saber] archive, used by the app I previously used to
write my handwritten notes, [Saber].
It is open source and cross-platform, which means you can
[download and install it][Saber] on
Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS or Android for free.
Once you have done that, you can download the `.sba` file and import it
into the [Saber] app on your device to
easily edit the PDF file.

The `.svgz` file is a Gzip compressed SVG file,
used by the application I currently use to write my handwritten notes,
[Stylus Labs Write].
It is also open source and cross-platform,
which means you can
[download and install it](https://www.styluslabs.com/download/) on
Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS or Android for free.
The free version of the iOS app is outdated and has watermarks
in the background though, which can be removed
via a one-time in-app purchase, which costs $12.98 SGD.
The paid version of the app also costs the same amount,
but it is the latest version.
Once you have done that, you can download the `.svgz` file
and open it in [Stylus Labs Write] to edit it.
Technically, you can edit the `.svgz` file without downloading
[Stylus Labs Write] by using any program that supports SVGs,
like Photoshop, GIMP, Inkscape, etc.
Heck, you can even edit it using your browser if you want to.
[Saber] is pretty much unmaintained, as massive bugs are not being fixed,
like crashes and freezes when using the app.
Most of the updates to the application are just updating dependencies,
and fixes contributed by the community are not being merged
despite the seriousness of the bugs.
Hence, I have moved to [Stylus Labs Write] instead.

The `.typ` file is a [Typst] file, which is an alternative
type setting language to LaTeX that is written in Rust.
You edit this file and re-compile it using the [Typst compiler]
to edit the PDF file.

---

If there is only one file, it should be a `.org` file,
so just click on it to view it.
The platform should display the file in an easily readable format.

## Special modules

There are some special modules I take that have a different
course code, but have pretty much the same content as the
usual module that everyone else takes. Here is a table
mapping out those modules.

| Special module                           | Normal module                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| SP0061 Science & Technology for Humanity | CC0007 Science & Technology for Humanity |

## Moved modules

There are some modules that I moved to a different repository
as the cheat sheet I made for those modules have outgrown their
use as a simple cheat sheet, and have become more of a proper resource
that should be maintained separately from this repository, which is
really just a dump of my university notes and tutorials.

| Module                                 | Repository link                                       |
