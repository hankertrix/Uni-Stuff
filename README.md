# Uni Stuff

Hello! This is the repository where I am storing all of my
university related things, so you can find my lecture notes
and tutorial answers here.
Hopefully this resource will help you in your university journey!

My first year and first semester was in August 2023,
so my first academic year is AY2023/2024.

## How the repository is organised

This repository is first split into folders for each year and semester,
with year 1 semester 1 being in the `y1s1` folder and so on.
Inside those folders are more folders for each of the modules that
I am taking for the semester, with the course code as well as
the course name in the name of the folder.
Inside those folders you will find the topics for those modules.
Finally, inside those folders, you will find my notes and tutorials.

## What's the difference between a `cheat-sheet` and `notes`?

A cheat sheet is basically just a compilation of all the things
I find important inside the lecture slides for a topic.
So things like definitions and important formulas
will be included in the cheat sheet,
as well as a few explanations and examples that
I find important for my understanding of something.
Notes are far more comprehensive as they include everything
that is in the lecture slides for a topic,
which means all the examples and explanations are included,
and you can use the notes to study instead of watching the lecture
or reading the lecture slides.
You can't really do that with a cheat sheet
since it only contains a few explanations and examples.

After the notes for maths module 1B is uploaded,
I will no longer be doing notes as it takes far too much time.
Instead, I will be doing cheat sheets for all topics after maths module 1B.

## There are multiple different files with the same name, which file should I be viewing?

TLDR: You should be viewing the **PDF** file.
If there is no PDF file in the folder, then view the **org** file.

There are usually three files with three different file extensions,
one with the `.org` file extension, another with the `.tex` file extension,
and one with the `.pdf` file extension.
The `.org` file is the raw org mode document that I write to create the
PDF file, which usually contains a lot of LaTeX fragments.
The `.tex` file is an intermediate file,
which is generated by the Org mode exporter when I export to LaTeX.
This `.tex` file is then processed by the LaTeX compiler
to generate a PDF file, which is the final result that you want to view.

---

If there are only two files, there will usually be a file with the `.pdf`
file extension and another file with either the `.tex` file extension
or the `.sba` file extension. You should be viewing the file with the `.pdf`
file extension, unless you are looking to edit the PDF file.

The `.tex` file in this situation is handwritten LaTeX,
and is not generated by the Org mode exporter.
You can edit this `.tex` file and re-compile it to edit the PDF file.

The `.sba` file extension is the proprietary export file format,
called [Saber] archive, used by the app I use to write my handwritten notes,
[Saber]. It is open source and cross-platform,
which means you can download and install it on
Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS or Android for free.
Once you have done that, you can download the `.sba` file and import it
into the [Saber] app on your device to
easily edit the PDF file.

---

If there is only one file, it should be a `.org` file,
so just click on it to view it.
The platform should display the file in an easily readable format.

## Special modules

There are some special modules I take that have a different
course code, but have pretty much the same content as the
usual module that everyone else takes. Here is a table
mapping out those modules.

| Special module                           | Normal module                            |

## Moved modules

There are some modules that I moved to a different repository
as the cheat sheet I made for those modules have outgrown their
use as a simple cheat sheet, and have become more of a proper resource
that should be maintained separately from this repository, which is
really just a dump of my university notes and tutorials.

| Module                                 | Repository link                                                                          |
